        "content": "Welcome to Metakgp, and thanks for considering contributing to this wiki! We are glad to have you. We hang out onSlack, do drop by to say hi :) Changing the content on any page or creating a new page is calledediting. Editing Metakgp wiki is really easy. Most of us have never edited a wiki before, and it can be quite scary to change an existing page, or create a new one. Don't worry, it's actually quite simple to do. Go to any page, and click the \"Edit\" link near the left of the search box. This will load Visual Editor, which is a very friendly and intuitive interface for editing. To create a new page, type the name of the page into the search box. The search results will give you an option to create the page. Before making decisions such as how to write acronyms, phone numbers, names of people etc, please visit theConventionspage.' Ready to edit, but not sure what you should write about? Here are some suggestions to help you get started: Make a page for your hall, society, club or student group. How many people does it have, and what makes it unique? (eg.Debating Society) Add an article about your research/internship program. Was it interesting? What challenges did you face, and what do other people need to know about it? (eg.BEST) Share some KGP lore. Do you know any interesting things about the place we live? Tell us how to get things done. Did you have to manage a difficult situation -DepC,Summer quarter, or something else? We want to know how you did it! Look atYellow Pages, and add a phone number for a service – it's really useful to have them all in one place! This wiki has a lot of powerful options, but it can be confusing initially. Here are some useful links to know about: Recent changes: This handy link on the sidebar will show you an overview of everything that's changing on the wiki. Really useful to see which pages are seeing activity, and what edits are being made. Talk pages: Every page on the wiki has an associated Talk page, where you can leave comments. This is useful for having a discussion about the content on the actual page. SeeHelp:Talk pages. User pages: You have your own page on this wiki –check it out! You can add information about yourself, or anything else you want, on this page. For example, many people find it useful to add handy links or snippets of text that they want to be able to access from anywhere, to their user page. Uploading and displaying an image This wiki can display any image fromMediaWiki Commons. To upload and display a new image: Uploada new image to MediaWiki commons. Make sure you have the rights to this image – either it should be yours, or you need to have permission from the owner. Once you've uploaded the image, you can click onInsert -> Mediain VisualEditor to insert the image anywhere on the wiki. If you need to use the image in an infobox, you can refer to the image by filename directly. To transfer images from flickr firstchange the licenseto anappropriate free licenseand then use theflickr2commonstool. You will need to give the userID of the photographer or photoset ID or photo ID to transfer the image. You can get to know your user IDhere. For more information, check outMediaWiki image help. Sometimes the Visual Editor doesn't have the full set of features that wiki markup offers. In those rare cases, click onEdit source, and take a look at the excellent and shortWikipedia editing tutorial. If you still face problems, don't hesitate to contact any of theadmins. Some pages, like this one, don't have Visual Editor enabled, and you must edit the source. Metakgp is a community driven wiki. KGPians are the editors of Metakgp, and no official organisation or student body controls it. The most active editors generally end up having the largest say in the wiki's policies.

This wiki is an open repository of community knowledge about IIT Kharagpur that anyone can edit. We hang out onSlack, come by and say hi. Links to our other communication platforms can be foundhere. Metakgp was started byVivek AithalandVikrant Varmaat IIT Kharagpur in 2014. After a period of inactivity, it was revived in 2015 with the help ofHarsh GuptaandVivek Rai. Statistics about top contributors can be found atSpecial:ContributionScores. 29th April 2015: Vikrant met Harsh, Sanyam and Vivek Rai at CCD and discussed the idea of a wiki for IIT-KGP, which he and his roommate Vivek Aithal started last year. Vikrant set up a mediawiki instance on digital ocean. May-June 2015: metaKGP was met by generous contributions by Vivek Rai, Kumar Abhishek and Harsh Gupta. Though everybody was busy with their intern so we couldn't get a lot done. 28th June 2015: we got the metakgp.org domain August 2015: we launched metaKGP to the public through shares on our facebook wall. 8th September 2015: we launched ourfacebook page 13th September 2015: we launchedmfqpa tool for searching question papers on the library'sprevious year question papers website. 16th September 2015: we started publishing (gymkhana)constitution fun factson our facebook page. 11 Feb 2016: Shashank Saraf generously agreed to let us use the metakgp Google Group name; it was previously used for \"Metallurgy and Materials Science- IIT Kharagpur, 2006\". -Why metakgp?Some motivations and goals. --Amrav(talk) -metakgp wants to give KGP its history.--Hargup(talk) Members of MetaKGP develop various projects, including this wiki. The code is developed onGithub, andhostedon DigitalOcean. Each project hasmaintainersthat are responsible for its development and have administrative control over its repository. The name of this community is writen in various ways: MetaKGPandMetakgpare also used in various places, whereas The \"correct\" way of capitalizing the name is disputed and members have differing opinions on it, unlikexkcdwhich has clear guidelines for it.

It comprises mainly of, but not limited to, current students, alumni, staff, and family of staff. The group also welcomes straight allies to join and support it. Ambar's vision for IIT Kharagpur isa campus devoid of discrimination against minorities on the basis of gender and sexuality, where such minorities feel safe and free. This includes existence of a safe space for people who are still coming to terms with themselves and their sexuality (and/or are confused about it), along with a commitment towards ending sexism, homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia, present both internal and external to the campus community.

        "content": "Constitution of the Technology Students' Gymkhana Technology Students’ Gymkhana is the hub of the numerous extra-curricular and cocurricular activities ranging from sports to music. The Gymkhana is managed by the students,\nfor the students, under the guidance and active participation of the faculty and staff members. Any extensive system of operation needs to be guided by rules, regulations and a constitution. The constitution of the Gymkhana was drafted in 1952 and was revised in 1974. With rapid changes occurring on various fronts in the Institute, the students have felt the need for some revisions of the constitution to reflect the changed condition. Professor S.C.Roy, the present President of the Gymkhana requested Professor Y.P.Singh. an old alumnus and presently a Professor of the Institute to examine the document and to propose revisions. After discussion with the Deans and the concerned student office bearers, the final revised version of the condition is presented here. I must acknowledge my gratitude to Professor Y.P. Singh and others who have contributed to the revised Constitution. I hope this Constitution will serve to heighten the involvement and commitment of the students to the Gymkhana activities. ( K. L. Chopra )Director, IIT, Kharagpur& RectorTechnology Students’ Gymkhana The Constitution of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana was drawn in the year 1952, and subsequently revised in 1974. The basic structure and philosophy of the Gymkhana as envisaged by the founding fathers of the Institute have stood the test of time, and have been instrumental in contributing to the all round development of the IITians during the last four decades. However, substantial structural changes during the last two decades have necessitated some modifications in the Constitution of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana. The proposed amendments have been evolved through detailed discussions with a broad cross section of the students and the academic community over a prolonged period, and aim to further enhance the role of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana in aiding its members in the cultivation of their interests in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. The major changes are in respect of the following: Structural adjustments in the composition of various Committees and Subcommittees for providing a greater degree of initiative to the Secretaries through a greater degree of decentralization. The Executive Committee has been redesignated as the Executive Council to reflect these changes. The Students’ Senate has been given its due recognition as an advisory body to the Vice-President on various matters relating to the Halls of Residence, disciplinary issues and general welfare of the student body. The Students’ Court would fulfill a long felt void and would promote the growth of a more responsible and more self confident student body. The functions of the Modelling Sub-committee have been redefined. This sub-committee would organize the Hobby Club and shall, in collaboration with the Nehru Technology Museum, organize an Inter-hall Modelling Competition in order to provide a new dimension and to give a fillip to the creative potential of the members of the Technology Students’ Gymkhana. It is fervently hoped that these suggested amendments would make the Technology Students’ Gymkhana instrumental in playing a more positive and vibrant role in adding many more dimensions to the multifaceted talents of the members.

It is under the Technology Students' Gymkhana and is a part of the Dramatics Subcommittee under the Social and Cultural Committee. ENCORE selection auditions are held once per year, only for first years, in August for an active membership for all four/five years. The society selects a batch of 30-40 first years (UG) and 5-10 (PG) at the beginning of the academic year soon after the welcome production. Selection procedure consists of tasks that judge voice modulation, intensity, speech and diction, confidence and acting skills. In rare cases, exceptional and highly enthusiastic people are also inducted into ENCORE who share a similar passion of theater and contribute to the society. Past members who were inducted include Kaustabh Khare. ENCORE has four governors selected by the society seniors every year who govern the society and represent it in the Gymkhana. Overall co-ordination during productions, outstations and competitions are handled by the governors. Within two weeks of the Autumn Semester starting, ENCORE performs its first production of the year. The cast ranges from second years to fifth years. Over the years it has been observed that ENCORE generally picks up comical plays and sketch comedy to entertain the freshers. This is also the first time the Governors for the new tenure are introduced to KGP. The freshers are given a thorough training of theatre oriented workshops that teaches them the basics of dramatics. Skills like voice modulation, voice intensity, dramatization, body posture, stage movements, third forms, etc are taught in groups. First years along with the four governors train for three weeks at the Vikramshila Foyer (commonly referred to as Baap Ki Jagah by the ENCORE fraternity). Occasional skits, monologues, and challenging impromptu are attempted to improve the versatility of the actor. For tenures in which a PG Batch is also inducted, separate workshops are conducted for them. The Governors with the help of the entire society train the first years and with rigorous practice put up a production, with the entire cast being first years. For tenures in which a PG Batch was also inducted, a separate production is done by them. Nukkad Natak is the only event during the entire year when ENCORE does a play/street play in Hindi. Only the second years take part in the Nukkad Natak competition organized during SpringFest. ENCORE also participates annually in the Stage Play event of SpringFest i.e. Rangmanch. The last act of the year (referred to as the Annual Production) is performed during End-March to Early-April. The Annual Production sees the most diverse crowd play together.

        "content": "TheDebating Society, IIT Kharagpur, abbreviated asDebSoc, is IIT Kharagpur's competitive debate organization. It participates with consistent success inParliamentary Debatesacross the world, and had organized the IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference and the IIT Kharagpur Parliamentary Debate in previous years. In 2020, a team from KGP DebSoc went on to becomethe first all-Indian team to reach the ESL (English-as-Second-Language) finals of Australs, one of the most prestigious debating tournaments in the world.\nIn 2024, a team from KGP DebSoc emerged as thewinners of ESL (English-as-a-Second-Language) finals of Uhuru Worlds, one of the biggest and most prestigious international tournaments. The Debating Society is always looking for smart, enthusiastic debaters, and takes in new members all year round. There is no restriction on the year of study, and members have joined as late as 4th year. However, to provide more structured training, and to spread awareness, it holds Fresher Selections and Senior Selections at the beginning of the year. This is followed by a training workshop, which lasts about a month, where newcomers to parliamentary debating are taught various facets and nuances of structured argumentation. The Debating Society tries to meet at least two times a week for practice sessions. These are usually conducted in the foyer of the Main Building, with multiple debates often happening around the place. University-level competitive debates have two preeminent formats - the 3v3 Asians Parliamentary Debate, and theBritish Parliamentary Debate, which has four teams of two in a single debate. In addition to foyer debates, it participates in national and international debating competitions all year round. Members choose their own teams or decide to adjudicate. Participating at many high-quality tournaments is regarded as the way to excel, and members are supported by the society for things like getting permissions from professors, and reimbursement of expenses. Other events conducted include the Intra-KGP Debate Tournament and theFoundation Daydebates. Although students have been arguing at IIT Kharagpur for over half a century, the activity was only institutionalized in 2009 as a part of the 'KGP Debate Club'. It was founded by Sumeet Mohanty (BT '11) and started as a loose affiliate of theTechnology Literary Society(TLS). The KGP Debate Club began its activities on campus as an active interest group and marked IIT Kharagpur's entry into competitive parliamentary debating. Membership was not exclusive - meetings and debates were open to all and were held in the institute foyer. There were only a handful of members in the Autumn of 2009 and almost all the early recruits were from TLS. The NLSPD 2009 in Bangalore was the first tournament at which the KGP Debate Club represented IIT Kharagpur. This was followed by participation at NUJSPD 2010 by a team of freshers. The Debate Club held its first open selections prior to this tournament, and all the participants for the tournament were selected here.[2] Incorporation as a Gymkhana society In Autumn, 2010, the KGP Debate Club was formalized as a full-fledged Gymkhana society independent of the TLS. The first governors were Achyut Bihani (BT '12), Shikha Singh (MA '13) and Anand Kr (CS '12). Early in the Autumn of 2011, the number of governors was increased to four, and the KGP Debate Club was rechristened as 'Debating Society, IIT Kharagpur'. Two of the Governors - Adarsh Mathew and Prashanth Durai - commissioned a logo for the society, and it was created by Avik Dey. In the same semester, the Debating Society andSpring Festagreed to jointly conduct IIT Kharagpur's first-ever Model United Nations Conference. Thus, IIT Kharagpur Model United Nations Conference was founded with Prashanth Durai as the firstSecretary-General.[2] 2010: Achyut Bihani (BT '12); Anand Kr (CS '12); Shikha Singh (MA '13) 2011: Adarsh Mathew (IM '14); Arpan Ahuja (MF '14); Piyush Bagaria (EC '13); Prashanth Durai (CY '14) 2012: Bibhuti Bhushan (BT '14); Sanat Mehrotra (EC '14); Shreeja Datta (EC '15); Sourya Dey (EE '14) 2013: Amrit Anand (EC '16); Shushman Choudhury (CS '15); Vikrant Varma (CS '16); Vivek Aithal (AE '16) 2014: Ankur Agarwal (GG '17); Manav Garg (AG '17); Sankalp Gourisaria (CH '17); Suprad Reddy (MI '16) 2015: Ayushi Mrigen (MA '18), Chandra Has Dondapati (EC '17), Kunal Jain (IM '17), Surya Chakrabarti (ME '17) 2016:  Aliya Jabbar (BT '19), Aradhana Kumar (CH '18), Gyan Darshan (BT '18), Ruchika Bhatia (HS '19) 2017: Prajwal Singhania (CS '20), Rohit Roy (BT '19), Rohit Sar (MF '19), Chandar Siddharth (MA '20) 2018: Suyash Ratna Tripathi (IM '20), David Vishal (CH '21), Rishiraj Bose (ME '20), Vignesh Viswanathan (CS '20) 2019: Astha Jakher(HS '22), Tiyasha Mitra(CH '21), Mirambika Sikdar(BT '22), Syamanthak Srikrishnan(BT '21) 2020: Saugandh Philkhana(EE '22), Tanay Raghavendra(EC '22), Devika Narayanan(MF '23), Simran Rajagopalan(HS '23) 2021: Anurag Kumar(ME '24), Jaya Kediya(MA '24), Mehul Gupta(IE '23), Sruthi Mahalakshmi(AG '24) 2022: Abhijna Choodi (HS '25), Diya Sarkar (CH '24), Shriya Harlapur (MA '25), Sugandh Sinha (CE '24) 2023: Allen Emmanuel Binny(EC '26), Ashley Placid(PH '25), Rahul R(EE '26), Sneha Dash(EC '26) 2024: Apoorva Pandey(AE' 27), Harsh Singh(EC' 27), Parvathy Venugopal(HS '26), Pranaya Chowdary(CS '26) 2025: Kevin Jais(AE' 27), Krushnashish Pradhan(ME' 28), Ritwik Suresh(EE '27), Shruti Gangrade(AG' 28) ↑2.02.12.2Verifiedbywhiplashon 2015-08-02.

(Hons.), B.Arch. (Hons.)** or Integrated M.Sc. Course will normally continue studying in that branch till completion. However, in special cases the Institute may permit a student, admitted through JEE, to change from one branch of studies to another after the first two semesters. Such changes will be permitted, strictly in accordance with the provisions laid down here in after. No student of B. Arch. (Hons.) course is allowed to change his/her branch of study and at the same time no student from other branches of study is allowed to take up B. Arch. (Hons.) course.

        "content": "We come togetherTo share our knowledgeAnd our experiencesSo that all may benefitFrom what one has learntAnd to createAn everlasting recordOf our fleeting passingThrough IIT KGP Often, information about various things in IIT Kharagpur is hard to find, possessed by a few privileged individuals, inconsistent across different sources, or simply anecdotal and unrecorded. I hope that the wiki model will be successful in centralising important knowledge about KGP. Additionally, vast amounts of information in the form of subjective experiences are lost as students pass out, their precious wisdom unrecorded. A more ambitious goal for the wiki is to capture some of these hard won insights so that other students don't face the same struggles unprepared. Finally, the most ambitious goal of the wiki is to nurture an attitude of collaboration, openness, self-improvement and curiosity. By documenting our lives in KGP, we may learn something new about it, and about ourselves. By sharing our knowledge and experiences, we may try harder to overcome our self-imposed restrictions and inhibitions, to be more understanding, and to grow. And if we look back years later at this record of our time here, it will be with the thrill of having created something permanent and useful for generations. Even if that last one doesn'tquitepan out, it's okay :) --Amrav(talk) 16:52, 16 May 2015 (IST)"

Here are some suggestions to help you get started: Make a page for your hall, society, club or student group. How many people does it have, and what makes it unique? (eg.Debating Society) Add an article about your research/internship program. Was it interesting? What challenges did you face, and what do other people need to know about it? (eg.BEST) Share some KGP lore. Do you know any interesting things about the place we live? Tell us how to get things done. Did you have to manage a difficult situation -DepC,Summer quarter, or something else? We want to know how you did it! Look atYellow Pages, and add a phone number for a service – it's really useful to have them all in one place! This wiki has a lot of powerful options, but it can be confusing initially. Here are some useful links to know about: Recent changes: This handy link on the sidebar will show you an overview of everything that's changing on the wiki. Really useful to see which pages are seeing activity, and what edits are being made. Talk pages: Every page on the wiki has an associated Talk page, where you can leave comments. This is useful for having a discussion about the content on the actual page. SeeHelp:Talk pages. User pages: You have your own page on this wiki –check it out! You can add information about yourself, or anything else you want, on this page.

It provides emergency services inside the campus and an ambulance is sent immediately after a call. On March 21, 2009, an erstwhile 3rd year undergraduate student Rohit Kumar went to the hospital for checkup. It was a Saturday evening and he was complaining of headache. Although there's no record of any report. Next morning, he had to re-visit the hospital because his conditions had gone worse and he was in severe pain. He was then sent back home with some prescribed painkillers. Unfortunately, while going back to his hostel he collapsed and his head hit a cow-trap. He was immediately taken back to the hospital where he waited around 3 hours to get an appointment with a doctor. After his arrival, the doctor without any treatment, referred him to Apollo Hospital, Kolkata stating that he needed a neurologist. He was put in an ambulance with two of his friends and one pharmacist and no trained paramedic. On the way, the conditions got worse and they decided to go for Midnapore Hospital instead. He was declared 'Dead on Arrival' at Medinipur Hospital. This incident lead to an outraged protest against the Director, IIT Kharagpur. Thousands of people silently protested in front of his bungalow. Seeing the director not taking any action in the regard of improvement of facilities in the hospital, outraged students demanded Director's resignation.

        "content": "180 Degrees Consulting - IIT Kharagpur (180DC) 180 Degrees Consulting is the world’s largest organisation for non-profits and social enterprises with operations in more than 35 countries. The IIT Kharagpur branch of 180 Degrees Consulting (abbreviated as 180DC) was founded in April 2020 by Amritash Bharadwaj, Nikita Kishore, Adarsh Gupta, Aniket Shah and Keshav Godala with an aim to provide quality consultancy services to socially conscious corporations and NGOs to help them achieve the impact they seek to create. Being students of the oldest, largest and most versatile of IITs, the team consists of driven and capable people with diverse skill sets across various fields. It is a platform where students can gain leadership skills, consulting experience and professional etiquette with a chance to derive value through the quality of their collaborative work. Selection procedures for 180DC are held at the start of the autumn semester. New recruits are taken in from the first year only. The selection procedure consists of multiple rounds of interviews and discussions wherein prospective members aren’t judged on their knowledge of consultancy frameworks, but rather their problem-solving approach and whether they are able to present their thoughts in a structured manner. The selection procedure evaluates the candidates onStructured Thinking, Problem Solving, Work Ethic, Time Management, Speaking, Writing and Design skills. Good knowledge of business and finance is appreciated but is not the main factor of evaluation. We expect an optimal amount of time and dedication. The main opportunity to learn in 180 Degrees Consulting is via training sessions. Seniors organise these sessions to polish the skills of new recruits and also teach them various consulting techniques and frameworks. These knowledge meetings also involve case study competitions/workshops. Advisorsconsist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the organisation. Directorsare members who are in their third year of study. They are responsible for heading various different portfolios and projects within the organisation. Executive Headsare the members who are in their second year of study. They are responsible for executing the portfolio and project work assigned by the Directors. Consultantscomprises the students who are in the first year. They take care of executing various plans and projects of 180DC The organisation’s work includes client negotiation, acquisition, onboarding and providing consultancy services to clients. The services include (but are not limited to) evaluating project feasibility, providing financial and CSR strategies, doing market research & data analysis etc. The deliverables provided have helped several NGOs and organisations in many ways like helping them getting more funds, solving infrastructural/systemic problems, acquiring more volunteers etc. 180DC has collaborated with various renowned organisations, some of them are listed below: Some of the top feedback which we have received from various clients: Client Feedback:“180 Degrees Consulting IIT Kharagpur was of immense help in making policies to recover revenue loss faced by the Madhya Pradesh Government due to COVID-19 pandemic. Their way of working is very organised and innovative. All the consultants we’d interacted with were very hardworking, inquisitive and enthusiastic. They found to be quick to grasp the requirements and work accordingly. We appreciate their efforts and applaud their dedication, they have made a huge difference.” Client Feedback:“The performance and practical insights provided by the team of 180DC IIT Kharagpur in the unemployment report was of immense help while planning programs in rural and urban areas of various cities. Consultants were equipped with knowledge of ML and Data analytics and handled large youth databases of 2000+ youth with utmost professionalism to provide us with data-backed insights. We hope to collaborate with 180DC for future projects. Client Feedback:“We found 180 Degrees Consulting, IIT Kharagpur works to be very impressive and phenomenal. We definitely appreciate the kind of work they have done and how well they analysed the ethos of Robin Hood Army”. This was one of the major initiatives taken by 180DC, IIT Kharagpur in 2024. PM school is an organisation that provides programmes for aspiring project managers which include live classes and case studies. 180 Degrees Consulting with the help of PM school had organised a workshop which involved giving tips and suggestions on how to crack project management interviews and also described the work of a project manager in a corporate company.

        "content": "AGV (Autonomous Ground Vehicle) is a multi-disciplinary research group underProf. Debashish Chakravarty, Mining department, aiming to build a fully operational self-driving car. It deals with varied projects involving computer vision,deep and reinforcement learning. AGV participates in Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) every year. This year they are also participating in Mahindra Rise Prize Driverless Car Challenge. The team in divided in embedded electronics, software and mechanical parts. \"Our vision is to have the world without road accidents; a place where people can commute without fear, to build the world’s most advanced and cost effective self-driving car.\" The present transportation system is getting increasingly expensive and inefficient. Over $230 billion are spent on car crashes every year, a majority of which are due to human errors. Congestion in total amounts to 10.5 billion litres of wasted petrol each year. Over 4.2 billion hours are wasted in traffic every year. There has been an increase in the number of accidents due to human errors such as drinking and driving. The solution to all these problems is a self-­driving car. With this inspiration, we have started Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) Research Group in IIT Kharagpur. We aspire to make India’s first fully operational self-driving car. IGVC (Intelligent Ground Vehicle Challenge) has a huge international media coverage. Being such a consistent performer and from the esteemed IITs we will attract the attention of both the International Media, as well as Newspapers and Magazines within the country. We will ensure that due credit is given to all our sponsors, and our vehicle will have your desired logo as well. The vehicle will be showcased at Kshitij, the Tech-Fest of IITKharagpur, which has a participation of 25,000 from outside Kharagpur. Other than Kshitij, we will showcase the vehicle at a variety of robotics exhibitions and workshops held throughout India. Additionally, the photo of the vehicle with the sponsors will be circulated all over the internet as well. Our team website would contain your company’s logo for the whole one year. IIT Kharagpur has immense talent of students and it will be mutually beneficial for the company to collaborate with us in order to attract more talent for their company. India has been on the verge of greatness for too long. It's time to change that. It’s time to make the world sit up and take notice. To create disruptive solutions that transform lives. To lead in enterprise and innovation. To see \"Made in India\" mean best in the world. This is Mahindra Rise Prize challenge aims at. We at AGV have been selected in the first round of this challenge and we are looking forward to applying our technology to a Mahindra Vehicle making it fully Autonomous. Intelligent Ground Vehicle Challenge The IGVC offers a design experience that is at the very cutting edge of engineering education. It is multidisciplinary, theory-based, hands-on, team implemented, outcome assessed, and based on product realisation. It encompasses the very latest technologies impacting industrial development and taps subjects of high interest to students. Design and construction of an Intelligent Vehicle fit well in a two-semester senior year design capstone course, or an extracurricular activity earning design credit. The deadline for an end-of-term competition is a real-world constraint that includes the excitement of potential winning recognition and financial gain. Students solicit and interact with industrial sponsors who provide component hardware and advice, and in that way get an inside view of industrial design and opportunities for employment. Team AGV has been constantly participating in Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and making a mark. A total of 43 teams across India, Japan, USA, Canada and Istanbul had registered for this prestigious navigation challenge. Our team gave the best of the colleges which included the likes of University of British Columbia, Georgia Institute of Technology, Michigan-Ann Arbor University, Ohio University etc., a run for their money. 7 teams from India contested in it including those from IIT Madras and IIT Kanpur. Team AGV finished as Runner-Up, winners being team CART Inc. at Bluefield State College, USA. We have developed our own series of Autonomous Cars called ‘Eklavya’. Over the years we have put out Eklavya, Eklavya 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0. Along with this we are developing Auro 666 and a 3D mapping API. We cleared the first three stages of Mahindra Rise Prize Driverless Car Challenge and have been awarded a Mahindra E2O electric car, which is being worked upon to be made driverless. The project has received a lot of media coverage and is one of the first steps by any Indian Company to promote the research and development in autonomous technologies. The lack of accurate maps of underground mines frequently causes mine accidents. Hazardous operating conditions and difficulty in access makes Robotic Exploration and Mapping an immediate and safe choice.The mapping algorithms used in the self-driving car can also be applied for mines. Large-scale construction projects might involve exploration of areas inaccessible or life­ threatening to workers. For such scenarios, a portable mapping solution could be hosted on a small flying quadrotor. The traditional surveying techniques for generating maps for city­ planning requires thousands of man-hours and are very expensive. Large cities can be mapped accurately and efficiently using a self-driving car equipped with 3­D laser mapping technologies. This can cut down on a lot of manual work and save time. With this view, we undertook the DIGITAL KGP PROJECT in which we mapped some parts of the IIT Kharagpur campus using the 3­D ENVIRONMENT MAPPING Technology. The use of special sensors in autonomous driving systems can detect approaching vehicles and road boundaries under poor lighting conditions. This feature could be widely used in vehicles as an essential safety measure. This system warns the driver as soon as the vehicle starts moving out of the lane. If the driver, for some reason, avoids the warning, the system takes over and moves the vehicle back into the lane. This technology completely removes the human error involved in the process. A sensing system has a wider field of view compared to an average human being. It is also capable of running calculations at over 2.5 GHz. Owing to these qualities, a sensing system can warn the driver beforehand about a probable collision. Overnight hackathons and workshops in IIT Kharagpur The product itself, merchandise worn by the team, banners, standees etc. 15000+ reach through our Social Media, Youtube and GitHub Handles. Research Papers and other technical publications. We are currently receiving funds through the Sponsored and Industrial Consultancy Cell (SRIC), IIT Kharagpur to carry on our research. These funds have constraints. As the sensors and other high-end technologies are quite expensive and cannot be bought solely through the funds from SRIC the team has to find alternative and cheaper methods to achieve what they want to. These methods are usually more time-consuming and less efficient. Also the funds from SRIC cannot be used to participate in IGVC, since the funding cannot be used in travel and logistics which in itself require huge budget. Even this time the team funded themselves and performed outstandingly. So we have rightly shown that on being supported we will definitely perform much better and efficiently. One example of our use of latest technologies on our work is the use of Velodyne LiDAR sensors to autonomously drive the Mahindra E2O car, which was highly successful.

        "content": "The idea behind AIESEC started in 1938, when representatives from schools across Europe exchanged information about various programs and schools that specialized in business and economics. Students were carrying out internships in other countries. Mostly on their own initiative but it came to a standstill with the onslaught of World War II. In 1944, the neutral Scandinavian countries were still exchanging students. In Stockholm, Bertil Hedberg, an official at the Stockholm School of Economics, and students Jaroslav Zich (of Czechoslovakia), Jean Choplin (of France) and Stanislas Callens (of Belgium) foundedAIESEC. This was the predecessor of AIESEC, which was officially founded in 1948. At the time, the organization's stated mission was “to expand the understanding of a nation by expanding the understanding of the individuals, changing the world one person at a time.” At the time of AIESEC's founding at the conclusion of the 1940s, Europe was in the midst of recovery from the war that dealt grave losses to its population. Factories and enterprises were in desperate need of executives, managers and leaders. The continent needed more than just business development, however; the war had severely damaged relations between European nations, and many members of the community felt steps needed to be taken to address this problem. AIESEC was formed to address both of these concerns. Students from seven nations: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden came together in March 1949 for the first International Congress of AIESEC in Stockholm. The founders composed a constitution for the new organization and defined a purpose: \"AIESEC is an independent, non-political, and international organization which has as its purpose to establish and promote the friendly relations between the members.\" In the first year of AIESEC's existence, 89 students were exchanged among the member nations. AIESECis an international non-governmental not-for-profit organization that provides young people with leadership development and cross-cultural global internship and volunteer exchange experiences across the globe, with a focus to empower young people so they can make a positive impact on society. The AIESEC network includes over 100,000 members in 133 countries and territories. It is the largest youth-run organization in the world. AIESECIIT Kharagpur conducts 2 selections in the entire academic year, once during the autumn semester and once during the spring semester. AIESEC provides a platform for students in IIT Kharagpur, by going on an international internship. These young individuals can develop their leadership potential by working and leading teams. Associate membership opportunities allow the students to work with various NGO partners of AIESEC, and represent their college as a part of campus ambassador program.The organisations products are Team Member Programme (TMP), Team Leader Programme(TLP), Incoming exchange (ICX) and Outgoing Exchange (OGX). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIESEC"

Progress reaches the society only when change is observed. \nAwaaz has tried to bring a change in the institute and students’ lives every then and now. Some of the initiatives have been described below: Sting Operation on Passport Bribery Case:A common complaint of the police officers asking for bribes was reported by a lot of students. The bribe amount varied from around 200 to 500 rupees. Awaaz conducted a sting operation and recorded the incident stealthily. The recording along with the report of a survey conducted by Awaaz was submitted to the concerned authorities and bribery was almost curbed. CV Module:When the ERP-based CV Module was newly introduced in the institute, the students faced a lot of problems due to the highly inefficient and buggy platform on which they were supposed to make their CV. Awaaz conducted a survey and prepared a report to submit to the administration. The report was considered by the administration and the CV Module was halted for a few days to come up with a better version of the same. Security Issue:In 2016, the campus had way too less number of security guards and CCTV Cameras. The report submitted by Awaaz regarding the same was considered and led to a lot of changes on the security front in the campus. Cleanliness Issue:On the behalf of the entire student community, Awaaz demanded an increase in the number of dustbins in the campus and use of steel dustbins instead of plastic ones. The struggle bore fruits and the requests were considered by the institute.

        "content": "+91 91223 72154 (Madiha Hanifa) Business Club, popularly known as BClub, is IIT Kharagpur’s in-campus society for all things business. It provides a platform for like-minded individuals who yearn to enrich their knowledge of business and apply their skills in various competitions like case studies and hackathons at the national and international levels. A family of around 70 student members, actively working under 3 wings:Strategy, Finance, and Analytics, BClub is constantly striving to bridge the gap between business and technology. Business Club was founded in 2009 asGenese-de-Strategieby Shailesh Gupta, Harsh Gupta, Srichandana Sanjeev, Sudipto Sannigrahi, and Mayank Mundra. Genesie-de-Strategie was started with a primary objective to educate the students about the world of business strategies. The founders felt a need for students to be informed about the working of the business world for their growth. Over the course of a year, they realised the need to have a more wholesome approach to the world of business. They formed the Business Club in 2010 with a broader perspective toward business. Indian Case Challenge,India’s largest case competition, is the flagship event of the Business Club. ICC now witnesses international participation as well. Affiliation to Technology Students’ Gymkhana(during the academic session 2014-15) brought official recognition to the club. The Business Club has started to reach out to the entire student population of the college by conductingOpen House Sessionsfor their benefit. Regularsocial media contentandblogsin the domain of finance, strategy and analytics are uploaded on all major social media platforms to keep readers updated. Selections to the Business Club are held at the beginning of the first and the second academic year. The selection procedure consists of agroup-discussionround followed by a personalinterviewfor the shortlisted candidates. Prospective members aren’t judged based on their business acumen, but on their ability to think clearly, present thoughts in a concise and structured manner, their dedication, and their zeal to learn. A training period called thesummer programis conducted for the students selected in the second academic year to level their knowledge with the students selected in the first year. During this time, they are provided with the same resources to learn everything necessary. After the summer program, every associate is evaluated on the same knowledge level and a final personal interview is conducted to select the students with the highest knowledge in the three domains. Other soft skills like communication are also kept in mind. Selected students are then assigned the position of sub-heads. Business Club has a four-level organisational structure. Advisorsconsist of fourth and fifth-year members and are the senior-most members whose experience helps in guiding the overall direction of the club. The executive body comprises ofGovernorsandHeadswho are in the third year of their study. They are responsible for heading various wings of the club and its management. The team ofSub-headsis responsible for the day-to-day functioning of the club and the execution of its plans. It consists of students in the second year of their studies. Associatesare the first years who have a passion to win and are generally business-oriented. These members are oriented towards gaining as much knowledge as they can from the pool of knowledge available to the seniors. The functional structure of the Business Club consists of three wings –finance, analytics, and strategy. These wings include all that happens within the world of business. To prepare the associates for the sub-head tenure, they are encouraged to participate in various activities to lay a strong foundation in the three domains of Analytics, Finance, and Strategy. These activities include: Intra-club case study Competition- The associate batch is divided into small groups and each team is allotted a sub-head as a mentor, who guides the associate batch in solving the problem statement. On the D-day, the executive batch judges the teams through their presentations, and valuable inputs are given. Knowledge meets- Organising knowledge meetings is the way by which knowledge dissipation happens in the Club. These meetings are conducted by Club members, where they meet and brainstorm on various topics of interest. A strong network consisting of resourceful seniors and mentor professors clarifies any doubts the members may have and make the meetings fruitful. Whitepaper -This event is organized so that the associates could choose and research the topic of their choice in the domain of the three wings of the B-club. During the event, Associates put around 20 days of research and at the end present their papers in front of the executive and sub-head Batch, where they give useful insights into the topic Drafting modules and blogs -Club members design modules and blogs in the three wings. These modules are released through the public handle. During the Summer holidays, many first-years apart from the Associate Batch are selected for the program as Summer Associates. Case study competition- This is the second intra-club case study competition. This time associates are made to solve the problem statement on their own without the mentorship of seniors, considering they have already done the courses in the three domains. Analytics competition- This competition concentrates on the core of machine learning. Associates are given a data set and this competition demands writing algorithms without using built-in libraries and maximizing the accuracy score on the given dataset. Trading Competition -During this competition Associates and Summer Associates create a mock trading account. This competition lasts for 10 days and associates carry out intraday trading based on the technical and fundamental analysis they have learned in the program. At the end of the summer program, based on the performance and participation in the summer program, associates are selected to be the part of sub-head batch. The club conducts a wide range of activities such as open house sessions and case studies enabling students to develop their business acumen by applying their skills and finding solutions to real-world problem statements. Ever since its inception in 2012, the Indian Case Challenge provides the best platform for undergraduate and graduate students from all over India to compete against each other and prove their business and entrepreneurial mettle in a real-life business case scenario. Not only are the participants expected to have strong business skills and financial understanding, but also a feeling for entrepreneurship and a sense of realizing market opportunities. ICC 2021, organized in association with Kshitij, was a huge success and received a whopping 3200+ unique registrations, including international participation. Business Club strives to impart basic knowledge regarding the various facets of business, in an attempt to make the students of IIT Kharagpur more equipped to thrive in the ever-evolving global industry. Open house sessions on basic finance, analytics, and strategy that are conducted in conjunction with organizations such as Alphabeta, ZS Associates, and IIMC Consulting Club have gone a long way towards this.

        "content": "Child Rights and You (CRY) IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter Child Rights and You (CRY) was started in 1979 by Mr. Rippan Kapur and 6 friends to improve the condition of the underprivileged Indian child. CRY IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter was started on 6th April, 2010  under the leadership of Ramanuj Lal and Monish Salhotra to bring about a change in the lives of the deprived children in and around their campus and formed CRY IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter. CRY IIT Kharagpur Chapter is a group volunteers with a passion to improve the lives of children of our society, specially around Kharagpur. The Chapter functions under CRY Kolkata Regional Office. As perCRY's website\"Way back in the 1970s, Rippan Kapur, a young airline purser, was driven by the extraordinary dream to see a day when no Indian child would be deprived of rights as basic as survival, participation, protection and development. Like many of us, Rippan too was upset when he saw disparities between privileged and underprivileged children. He hated to see children begging and working as servants. Unlike most of us though, he did something about it. He joined his school’s social service club and read to the blind, visited children in hospitals, held reading and writing classes for street children, and started a free dispensary at a slum the club adopted. To raise funds for these activities, the club sold milk. It even won a shield for the best Interact club! These qualities of resourcefulness and determination came in handy. In 1979 Rippan and 6 friends started CRY with Rs 50 around his mother’s dining table. They felt that something needed to be done to improve the situation of the underprivileged Indian child. Uncharacteristically, given their backgrounds and motivations, they chose not to start a grassroots-level implementing organisation working directly with and for underprivileged children. They opted instead to make CRY a link between the millions of Indians who could provide resources and thousands of dedicated people and organisations at the grassroots-level who are struggling to function for lack of them. This “link” or enabling position has determined CRY’s strategic choices at every juncture – from the fundraising methods it employs, to the nature of its relationship with the NGOs it partners with.\" To bring a change was the thought of a handful of students of IIT Kharagpur, in March 2010. They joined hands under the leadership of Ramanuj Lal and Monish Salhotra to bring about a change in the lives of the deprived children in and around their campus and formed CRY IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter. With the help of Saptak Mohanta, a former intern at CRY Kolkata and few other motivated acquaintances, a strategic team was formed. It has gradually become a decent group of students from various fields of engineering, science, law and MBA. The initiative was flagged off with the launch of a photography contest in the campus which witnessed participants submitting their entries on issues of child rights in and around their campus which often remains unnoticed. CRY does not believe in running schools or orphanages or initiating vocational training. CRY believes in permanent change, policy level and implementation level change, so that the change impacts millions of children, is permanent or long term in nature, the children do not have to depend on NGOs for their welfare and it does not substitute the role of the state in ensuring child rights. We, under the IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter, have taken some initiatives like Mid-day meal project, Barrier-Free IIT Kharagpur project etc. Our biggest achievements till date are: 1. Successfully catalyzing implementation of Mid-Day Meal in Mirpur Adivasi Primary School along with recruitment of new teachers. 2. Included as a part of the 'Committee for the welfare of Physically Challenged students of IIT Kharagpur'. 3. Conducted an Access Audit of IIT Kharagpur, with instructions from the Dean (UGS) and submitted a report that resulted in infrastructural changes in the campus including building of ramps. 4. Conducted numerous RTE campaigns to promote Right to Education Act and other education related policies. 5. Organized two international photography competition entitled Focus Right to promote child rights. 6. Team \"Project Baalrakshak\" conducts Awareness cum Workshop on Child Sexual Abuse for the children and their parents in assistance with Paschim Medinipur District Police. Under this project till date 84 sessions are being conducted in 20 schools were children from nursery to class XII participated, also 32 sessions were conducted with the parents of those children. Till date around 5352 children and parents have attended the sessions. Project Baalrakshak has been recognized by Kharagpur Municipality. Team \"Project Baalrakshak\" has secured \"3rd Prize\" for presenting \"Poster\" regarding the work on \"Child Sexual Abuse\" in \"2nd International Workshop (The Science of Happiness) - Happiness and Wellbeing: The Road Beyond\" which was conducted by Rekhi Centre of Excellence for the Science of Happiness at IIT Kharagpur from 4-6 April 2019. CRY IIT Kharagpur Chapter has various activities occurring on a regular basis. From Mars Orbital Missions to Curiosity Rover, from breathtaking researches in Artificial Intelligence to audacity in medical technology, from astonishing expeditions in the deepest of the oceans to lofty skyscraping infrastructures, the humanity has arrived at its dawn where the development had never earlier reached and sustained this great pace that it has now, the global economy has never been so stable, survival has never been such a duck soup.\nBut even for all these things, where are we still? Sometimes, we fear and wonder if in times like these, will childhood be as gleeful and enjoyable. But, unfortunately, that is the least of the worries we can think of. According to the statistics, one of the surveys sampled over more than 45,000 children in the age group 12-18, across different states of the country, revealed that half of the children were victims of child sexual abuse in one way or another. Adding to it, the taboo and fear of society are still ingrown in the people as one in four cases of child sexual abuse goes unreported. Victims of child sexual abuse are about four times more likely to develop symptoms of drug abuse and experience PTSD as adults and are about three times more likely to experience a major depressive episode as adults.\nPOSCO Act which defines a child as any person below the age of 18 years and provides protection to all children under the age of 18 years from the offenses of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography was passed in the parliament in 2012, but still as we can see from the stats, we are far from making our country, in all its truest forms, safe for children. Moved by these atrocities and himself being a survivor of child sexual abuse, Rajarshi Debnath, a research scholar and a thoroughly motivated volunteer in CRY IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter, now also a recipient of iVolunteer awards came up with a little thought of doing something for the children, trying to prevent child sexual abuse by making people aware of it. This small idea was named \"Project Baalrakshak.\" It all started two years back, in 2016. This idea of Child Sexual Awareness Workshops, as prolific as it did sound was challenging in all its means. It was a hard task to get suitable enough volunteers who could be dedicated and deliver the sensitive content appropriately and convincingly to the audience which was to comprise of children from classes nursery to 12th, parents and teachers. Tackling with all these issues the first workshop was eventually conducted in Balrampur high school in Kharagpur in September 2016. Though, there still were many troubles, Rajarshi stood unfaltered, finally getting a very dedicated team of his own, with the help which Project Baalrakshak has now gained widespread fame, from making his founder Rajarshi Debnath, a finalist in iVolunteer Awards 2019 to gaining assistance from Mednipur District Police, getting featured in a total of 22 print and digital media, and reaching around 5200 children, parents/guardian in a total of 19 schools, in its two years of working period. Team Project Baalrakshak also received a letter of appreciation from the Ward Counselor of Kharagpur. As a result of Team Project Baalrakshak's attempts, many children and parents had finally broken down their silence and talked about sexual abuse that the children were a victim of. Furthermore, it was found that in 19% cases, culprits were unknown, 57 % were family friends/friends, 21 % close relatives, and 12 % school/tuition teachers, which to a large extent matches with the national reports. Earlier Team Project Baalrakshak had to approach schools and convince them for their sessions, but now for the success, they have attained in their field, they're now actively invited by schools for conducting sessions. Team has conducted workshops in Kharagpur, Medinipur and Jhargram. This team is also featured in \"LINK (LBSNAA Innovation NetworK)' which is a platform working to connect the needs of the field administrators to a wide audience of technology providers, innovators, skilled man-power ecosystems and finance sources. Things don't change as swiftly as we sometimes want them to be, nevertheless they do remain in that state of stagnancy as it is for the sheer and consistent efforts of those around who seek to get the change, no matter what it takes and how it takes, their results will definitely mark the screen for both the upcoming and ongoing generations; seekers, believers and finally, achievers. Currently, Team Project Baalrakshak is headed by Ms. Parama Mukhopadhyay and Mr. Turin Datta who took charge on February, 2019. C.R.Y is an non profit and non government organisation working for the betterment and upliftment of the underprivileged children in India. We are the volunteers at the Kharagpur Chapter under C.R.Y., Kolkata where our mission is to develop the condition of the children around and inside the campus. The most active section of our chapter is the team who oversee the school sessions. Every Saturday, we go to middle schools at Arasini and Amlatoria where we teach and interact with the children from Classes I to IV. Our main aim is to cover the things which they otherwise are not able to do in their regular course curriculum. We cover things like basic maths, story telling, puzzles, games, science experiments, good food habits and importance of health. For the children at Amlatoria, with the efforts of the volunteers, we have successfully built a playscape at the school playground. We also have bought a projector for the school at Amlatoria and in pursuit of buying one more for the other one. We, as volunteers want that the children should learn good amount for moral and social etiquettes for a good and decent survival in this cut throat world. Then only will our long term goal will be achieved. C.R.Y IIT Kharagpur Volunteer Chapter organises medical camps every year at Amlatoria and Arashini villages. Medical camps are organised to make basic healthcare accessible for all. These villages have no healthcare facilities or even a qualified healthcare worker. Majority of the people living in remote villages are daily wage labourers, who earn very meagre income. They don’t go hospital or get a health checkup even when they are sick. Because, their little income won’t be sufficient to afford to the costs of getting a good health checkup or buying the medicines the doctor has prescribed for them. \nMedical Camp conducted last time was a huge success with more than 200 villagers attending the camp. A group 16 doctors were a part of this camp and they personal attention to everyone. Medicines were given free of cost. CRY IIT Kharagpur volunteer chapter conduct school sessions on a regular basis to motivate children for their better future. Education does not simplify mean the ability to read and write, So for the complete process of development, volunteers conduct science exhibition every academic year in which volunteers prepare various science models for children and present them to the children to explain and understand science practically. Science exhibition is mostly directed towards the basic science in daily life like respiration, fire burning, water absorption by plants. Volunteers made models to explain to the children the basic sciences to increase interest  and relate to their daily life so that they can understand easily. Community meeting, a gathering in which we see a participation from the parents, guardians and other members of the society, we stand up to focus on the potholes, discuss about their causes and find solutions to them. Community levels on a village level mainly aims to bring in light the various issues that the children are facing and make the people aware of certain topics which might go neglected if unattended, but tend to have a big impact on the lives of children. Certain issues like sanitation,  basic child rights, menstruation, importance of mental health, safe drinking water, first aid methods, importance of basic education especially for girl child etc. need to be projected before the community to them aware of it as it indirectly helps children as they are the members of the community as well and if the community nourishes, children are defaulty the benefiitters. The contents discussed there is pre-prepared which is delivered by our volunteers in an overall interactive session. In the Accupressure awareness community meeting, held at Arasini School, awareness was spread about the various acupressure points realizing that the people at the villages lack basic medication. Another meeting focussed on the menstrual health of women. People were made aware about what is menstruation and what kinds of problem women have during menstruations and their solutions were discussed. They came to know how the age old taboos have no scientific base and that the periods are completely normal, and any problem can be solved by correct consultation from the doctor and by maintaining hygiene.\nThe latest meeting was based on the purity of water in the water sources around the village. There is a high possibility of them being contaminated by high arsenic content which is harmful for both humans as well as for the crops. Their harmful health effects, sources of contamination, methods of identification and filtration of water techniques were discussed in detail. Such meetings provide an easy yet effective way for people to come together and discuss their problems and viewpoints and find solutions together for the betterment of the community as a whole. We at CRY, IIT Kharagpur are constantly putting efforts for more and more such meetings to solve as many problems as we can to bring a positive effect on their lifestyle and add meaning to their life. Child rights and you is a non-profited organisation which works in different aspects of developing and protecting a child life by different means one of the aspect is to free the country from child labour. Child labour is the service paid by the children in their childhood in any field of work. This is done by the child own due to the lack of resources for the life survival, irresponsibility of the parents or forcefully by the owner for increasing their return on investment at low investment. It does not matter the cause of child labour as all the causes force children to live their life without childhood. Childhood is the great and happiest period of the lives of everyone during which one learns about the basic strategy of the life from parents, loved ones and nature. Child labour interferes with the proper growth and development of the children in all aspects like mentally, physically, socially and intellectually. The volunteers and members of cry IIT Kharagpur has dedicated there every dime of potential to make the IIT Kharagpur campus free of child labour and for that they have conducted many surveys inside the campus in different section and has made a stats to show that the campus of IIT Kharagpur is finally free of child labour. Childhood is the most beautiful part of our lives, full of fun, play and activities. But some children never get to see what a playground is. To give the chance of playing in a playground to the children of Amlatoria Primary School, CRY IIT Kharagpur Chapter organised a fundraiser to build a playground. The fundraiser started in the beginning of 2018, aimed to raise funds of Rs. 1,25,000 through the crowdsourcing platform, Ketto. The designs for the playscape were made by Anthill Creations and the playscape was made from tyres and other recyclable materials. The project had a support of 159 contributors who helped by donating to make this project a reality. The contributors included students and professors of IIT Kharagpur as well as many well wishers. Door-to-door as well as social media campaigns helped to draw contributors to this. Funds were also raised for this at the stall set up during Spring Fest, in order to reach people outside Kharagpur. Since the playground has been constructed, children have a chance to play among various swings and mazes constructed on the ground. This play inculcates a feeling of curiosity, inquiry and adventure. Even now, the children are building memories on that playscape that they will cherish for a lifetime. We know that almost every child is getting education, but are they  getting proper education, with sufficient modern facilities? The answer is ‘no’. Still There are schools where students don’t get good quality education and not exposed to the outer world or current affairs in their own country Eg: who is the prime minister of India.The children need special guidance to know about all these things i.e. good communication skills and other parts of education like sciences etc. Volunteers of  CRY IIT Kharagpur are trying to tackle this problem. One of the steps taken by these volunteers is using projector in the nearest government school named Amlathuri. Due to the poor facilities in the school children are not able to learn subjects well so volunteers of CRY IIT Kharagpur bought a projector and they are giving training to the teachers sing this projector the volunteers want show some videos of English stories(so that it would be helpful for their improvement in communication skills in English and some videos related to other subjects in their course). The teachers given training to use this projector so that in the absence of the volunteers they can use it and show the videos related to respective topic. CRY IIT Kharagpur Chapter has members from all sections of IIT Kharagpur's Student Body including UG, PG and RS. Currently the administrative heads are Ashish Rathor (NA '20) and Vikram Chugh (CE '20) CRY - Child Rights and You is an Indian Non Government Organisation that catalyses change in the lives of underprivileged children in India by restoring their rights.

Every member is by default invited to make presentations, with the liberty of content and duration. While the delivery is on, the topic is open to the house for questions and to add to any of the subtopics covered. Although they need not be after rigorous research or core calculations, such content is more than welcome. A reliable source is acceptable for discussions as well as presentations.\nIt provides a learning platform for students from all disciplines and areas irrespective of their year of study. Presenters include students and research scholars presently working in the fields. Alumni of IIT Kharagpur are a very important source of funds for development projects within the Institute. Taking this into account, E-Cell has a unique programme by which it recommends to the alumni network, certain good ideas that students of the institute have come up with. These entries are then scrutinized by the respective alumni, who then help finance or mentor these ideas, as they develop into a full-grown company. Innovation Platform (IP) is a platform provided by E-Cell for those students interested in starting-up. Entrepreneurial ideas are invited from the First Year students of the Institute, and the best among these, selected by professors, are then provided with funding by TIETS and mentoring by the professors. This takes place alongside the regular academic course, so that when the students leave the Institute at the end of their fourth- or fifth- year, as the case may be, their idea grows into a company that can face the stiff competition in the real world. Some of these ideas, related to product designing have been awarded the covetedKishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana(KVPY) scholarship, offered by the Government of India. Rajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship TheRajendra Mishra School of Engineering Entrepreneurship, IIT Kharagpur was started in the year 2010, largely due to the efforts of E-Cell. This is the first school in India, which imparts entrepreneurial education at college level. Students of IIT Kharagpur have the option to take up the M.S. course offered by SoEE, alongside their regular B.Tech course, and upon successful completion of the both the courses, are awarded a Dual Degree (B.Tech.+M.S.). \nUnder this course, students have subjects which, unlike MBA courses that deal with corporate management, help them in the specific task of management within a startup, which is quite different from the former. In the fifth-year, students are provided with funding up to Rs. 1 Lakh and also mentoring and incubation to enable them to develop their own company. Deferred Placement Programme (DPP) acts as a cushion to those who want to pursue with their entrepreneurial idea after completion of their study in the Institute. Under this programme, if the student does not wish to take up a campus placement offer, he/she can pursue with their startup, and if, after a period of one year, they wish again to take up a job, may attend the campus-interviews in the year subsequent to that of their passing out.\n IIT-Kharagpur is the first institute to offer this programme at Undergraduate-level. TheKairos Society, a US-based not-for-profit student-run organization[14]organizes an annual Summit on Entrepreneurship. In the 2010 edition of this summit, the Indian team consisted of four members from E-Cell. Furthermore, the delegation was formally endorsed by Mr.Sashi Tharoorpersonally.[citation needed] ↑http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-05/news/34926566_1_fms-students-e-cell-student-activities ↑http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-21/indore/35952856_1_iit-k-entrepreneurship-awareness-drive-iit-kharagpur ↑http://www.stepiitkgp.in/otheractivities.html ↑http://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/about_us/portfolio ↑IIT Kharagpur event comes to NIT Rourkela ↑http://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/events/esummit/ ↑http://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/events/ead ↑http://www.khemkafoundation.org/awards/social-entrepreneur-of-the-year/2008-finalists/arbind-singh-nidan ↑Drayton, Bill.http://www.betterworld.net/quotes/entrepreneur-quotes.htm ↑https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152564437703266&set=a.137744623265.142018.129788793265&type=1&theater ↑http://www.ecell-iitkgp.org/events/guest-lectures ↑http://www.neaiuv.com/ourppl_vinoddham.htm ↑http://www.kairossociety.com/about/about-kairos-society/ Science and Technology Entrepreneurs' Park, IIT Kharagpur All articles with unsourced statements Articles with unsourced statements"

It is mainly run by the students of IIT Kharagpur with the help of professors of IIT Kharagpur and local citizens of Gopali village. Jagriti Vidya Mandir was started in the year 2008 in a rented campus, and was shifted to a permanent campus in the year 2012. LIGHT, the pan- India expansion initiative of the socity, was started in the year 2017. Marking illiteracy as its prime concern, GYWS embarked on an education program in April 2008: Jagriti Vidya Mandir, an English Medium primary school. Its main motto is \"not to make the children literate, but to make them educated. Foundation Day:It is conducted in the month August every year. Members of GYWS conduct events and various competitions for the children. Teachers’ Day:We celebrate Teachers’ Day in our school to show our respect to our teachers and to make our students know the importance of teachers in life. Sports Day:It is the annual sports meet conducted in our school. It is conducted in the month of October. Republic Day:Speech by the chief guest, flag hoisting followed by the performances of the children takes place. Aashayein:It is the Annual day celebration of our school in which the students of JVM come and perform in IIT KGP so that they get a broad platform. Generally, it takes place in the month of March. Skill development: Under this initiative, our objective is to impart skills to the youth first so that they can become an earning hand for their family.In this program, we train and develop educated but unemployed youth in line with industry requirements and provide them employment opportunities. Live Project: Live Project is the channel to put the budding managers on the track of social work. The project involves in selecting the potential candidates from the various institutions giving them the liberty to work on a problem and expanding the scope of the work. Greenovation:It is an ambitious project aimed at introducing low cost and organic farming techniques to farmers of nearby areas of kharagpur. School children are also involved so that they can develop  interest in agriculture. Under Teacher Training ,the PG and RS students try to help the teachers to improve their ability to teach.The students of JVM are taught how to operate computers in this initiative.We plan to extend this initiative for the students of other schools too.A weekly Science based fun activity has been conducted in Jagriti Vidya Mandir. Objective is to bring gleams in the eyes of children while learning in school. The students conduct sessions to project curious science and textbook fundamentals in an Involved manner.Along with the regular school, JVM students are also taught on Sundays.They are motivated to study hard and also are given coaching for JNV entrance test. Living In Greater Horizons Together. After the success of strategies and plans of the Gopali Youth Welfare Society (GYWS) near the area of IIT Kharagpur, the society planned to reciprocate similar models of social upliftment throughout the nation.LIGHT currently has four centers-Bhopal(MP), Gaya(Bihar), Kancheepuram(Tamil Nadu), Samvedana(Maharashtra). Aimed ‘ Generating Employment, Preserving Environment and empowering women ‘ , As part of this project, students volunteer to collect old newspapers from the Halls of Residences of IIT Kharagpur. These are given to poor rural women, free of charge, to make into ‘thongas’ or paper bags. Currently 30 women are associated with the production process who were given a week long training to make thongas. PaperKraft thus provides an opportunity to the destitute women to become self-employed. Also it promotes a cleaner and greener environment as it recycles degradable waste materials into something and also provides a viable substitute to plastic bags which are non-biodegradable. Thus PaperKraft is a sustainable, employment-generating, and environment friendly. K.B.C.[1]is an initiative started by Gopali Youth Welfare Society &Student Welfare Group -IIT Kharagpur.\nIt was realised by us that whenever there is a requirement of blood, many people are willing to donate blood but due to some or the other reasons communication gap becomes their barrier and as a result prompt help doesn't reach to the patient which is very essential in case of an emergency . K.B.C.  can become a sailing medium of contact for the donor and patient and this particularly is our motto along with spreading awareness about blood donation behind starting such a program. K.B.C. is also associated with 'Kharagpur Voluntary Blood Donor Organisation (KVBDO)'and have contacted the local hospitals of Kharagpur including Kharagpur Railway Hospital.\nIt's not that K.B.C is only for the students but it will benefit local people in and around Kharagpur. Some of the kids need to travel long distances to come to school and then go back again. Owing to these hectic travel, GYWS initially booked a Cab to supplement their requirements. But the cab has been unable to reach out every child because of which students either walk down the road or their parents have to go with them. So, GYWS members collect bicycles from passing out IIT Kharagpur students, repairs them and gives them to the JVM children. In this way, children coming from far off places can travel comfortably. Yogdaan is an initiative taken by GYWS in which the members go door to door of each and every student of IIT Kharagpur campus and request them for donation for their school construction project.Since last 3 years they have been doing yogdaan annually and have been getting a very good response from them every year. With the wholehearted support from students in the very first year of yogdaan, GYWS had bought land for school construction, and from the fund of next yogdaan, two classrooms had been completed there and from last year's yogdaan fund, the work is in progress currently, and the good news is that school has been started in new campus. While everyone gets busy enjoying during the glamorousSpring Fest, GYWS Members in turn look after the stall which is majorly prepared to promote the activities and partially to collect funds  for the betterment of the children. Like every other school, JVM also celebrates Annual Day, which has been named Aashayein, with full flair. First Annual Day was held in 2009. Support by advisory committee and presence of dignitaries which includesDirector, IIT Kharagpur Prof. Partha Pratim Chakrabortyhas helped GYWS & JVM celebrate annual days without any serious concern with limited monetary resources. Taking part in promoting education for the children belonging to destitute families. Making people aware of the rights, duties and responsibilities as an individual, a villager, a citizen.

The current form of KLUG was formed by Ramkumar Ramachandra (PH '12), Sanjoy Das (MA '13) and Anurag Priyam (ME '13) in 2011. The discussion at KLUG typically do not have a fixed agenda. People start off by discussing different projects they have been working on but often conversations diverge to very diverse topics including anything from history, privacy and copyright laws, economics to philosophy. KLUG follows a flat hierarchy and an system of open membership. Open membership implies that anyone is free and welcomed to attend the discussion. New members are usually asked to introduce themselves to the group. Important minutes of the meetings or meetup notices are posted to theKLUG's google group, which is open for anyone are join.

It is a research group sponsored bySRICas part ofCentre for Excellence in Robotics. The aim of the research group is to make autonomous soccer-playing robots and participate in international competitions likeRobocupandFIRA Roboworld Cup. Undergraduate students from all departments and years are a part of this team. The principal investigator for the project is Prof. A.K. Deb and it is also mentored byProf. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay, Prof. D.K. Pratihar and Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar.[1] The roots of KRSSG lie withTechnology Robotix Societyas one of the alumni, Aamir Ahmad interned at theInstitute for Systems and Robotics (ISR)underProf. Pedro Lima(former trustee, Robocup Federation), convincing him to bring Robocup to India. Robocup@India challenge was organised by IIT Kharagpur in 2009. This event was the first of its kind in South East Asia and with this India joined the elite body of only 18 nations worldwide to host such a league. Students of IIT Kharagpur itself participated in this event, forming KRSSG. Following the event, KRSSG got faculty attention which prompted Prof. Jayanta Mukhopadhyay and Prof. Sudeshna Sarkar to formally take it up as a research project under them in 2010. This gave KRSSG its first funding from the institute and students started to join the group. With Sanjiban Choudhury and Kaustubh Tripathy taking it as their Bachelor's and Master's Thesis Projects, KRSSG soon grew to expand to a group of 10 students aiming to participate in FIRA 2010. KRSSG participated in FIRA 2010 with purchased robots, held in Bangalore with Sanjiban as the sole representative since it was during mid-semester exams. Although the team was eliminated in the first round, the international exposure proved to be very useful.[1] Following this, the team started to design their own chassis and circuits. KRSSG then next attempted to participate in FIRA 2012 in Bristol, UK. The team, led by Gaurav Rathi, were all set to leave when their visa was denied. The next iteration, FIRA 2013, was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia which saw successful participation. The mechanical design, circuit fabrication, control code and the AI were all developed by students of the group. FIRA Malaysia was also KRSSG's maiden entry into the Simurosot simulation league. KRSSG was one of only two teams who were using self-manufactured robots in the event along with Team Sahas from IIT Madras. Moreover, FIRA 2013 was the first time an Indian team won a match in FIRA.[1] Following this, KRSSG participated in FIRA 2014 Beijing, China and FIRA 2015 Daejeon, South Korea.[1] 2009: Kaustubh Tripathi (CS '10) 2010: Sanjiban Choudhury (EE '11) 2012: Gaurav Rathi (CS '13), Shourav Chakravarty (AE '14) 2013: Harsh Surana (ME '14), Shourav Chakravarty (AE '14) 2014: Ashish Daga (ME '16), Soumyadeep Mukherjee (CH '16) 2015: Akshay Gupta (CS '16), Raunak Dhaniwala (EC '16), Seemant Jay (ME '16) 2016: Abhinav Agarwalla (MnC '18), Kumar Abhinav (CH '18), Kaustubh Mundhada (EC '17), Dhananjay Yadav (ME '17) 2017: Gunjan Sengupta (MT '18), Ankit Lohani (CH '18), Rishabh Jain (EE '18) 2018: Sudarshan Sharma (EC '20), Mayank Bhushan (CS '20), Ankush Roy (ME '20), Buridi Sree Aditya (CS '20) 2019: Tanishq Jasoria (MnC '21), Ashish Kumar Gaurav (MnC '21), Shivam Kumar Panda (ME '21), Shubhanan Shriniket (CS '20) This project was a result of the success of the RoboCup India Challenge in the campus in August 2009 and led to the formal creation of KRSSG. The aim of this project is to develop a team of autonomous robots in accordance with the rules of International RoboCup Small Sized League. Some notable highlights of this project are the development of a team of omni-directional robots with linear and chip kicker that shoots and chips a golf ball.[2] Robocup 3D Humanoid Simulation league The RoboCup 3D Simulated Soccer League challenges control of virtual humanoid team of robots competing against one another in a simulation of the rules and physics of a game of football. This aims to control different kinds of humanoid robot models which has a field of view and also simulates communication between players like in real world soccer. KRSSG started working on this league in early 2015.[2] The aim of the project is to develop a team of autonomous robots in accordance with the rules of RoboCup Small Sized League and the Mirosot league of the World Championship conducted by Federation of International Robot-soccer Association (FIRA). This involves development of a team of differential drive robots. KRSSG developed two versions of the Mirosot robots and participated in 4 FIRA Roboworld Cups.[2] FIRA Simurosot is a simulation league of differential drive robots playing soccer. KRSSG started working on this after 2010. KRSSG has participated in Simurosot in3 FIRA Roboworld Cups.[2] KRSSG has also started working on humanoid robotics. With students working on simulation league and also trying to get a Darwin Mini playing soccer, KRSSG is also working on designing it's own humanoid and getting it to play soccer.[2] Code-O-Soccer is a coding competition conducted by Kharagpur RoboSoccer Students' Group in the month of October, the main aim of the event is to introduce the concept of autonomous soccer playing robots in students mind and motivating students to create a challenging strategy using the provided API on a three vs three robot match for which robots are provided by KRSSG. It is going national for the first time in 2015 in collaboration with IEEE.[2] KRSSG also has conducted workshops in IIT Kharagpur with IEEE and Intel to spread the culture of robotics in India and also to display it's work and skills.[3] KRSSG Team is divided into four sections:[2] AI or Coding Team is the team that develops the strategy and high level control of the robot(s). It is responsible for developing the code architecture for robot control. Embedded Electronics Team is responsible for developing the on-board control system and circuits of the robot(s). They work on cutting edge electronics and design and test the circuits followed by fabricating them. Mechanical Design team is responsible for designing the mechanical structure of the robots followed by it's manufacturing it. Prototypes are designed prior to final manufacturing and every design is tested rigorously on simulation and on prototypes before final manufacturing. Management team is responsible for the Public Relations including website and Facebook page along with the sponsorships for the team. They manage the events conducted by KRSSG and also attempt to bring collaborations with industries. ↑1.01.11.21.31.4VerifiedbyDementoron September 18, 2015. ↑2.02.12.22.32.42.52.6KRSSG Website Pages using duplicate arguments in template calls"

It is under the Technology Students' Gymkhana and is a part of the Dramatics Subcommittee under the Social and Cultural Committee. The youngest of all dramatics societies, Technology Dramatics Society - Prasthanam has grown in leaps and bounds since being recognized by the Technology Students' Gymkhana in 2013. It is a society formed to assimilate, perpetuate and integrate the rich culture and dramatics heritage of the Telugu speaking people into the mainstream culture of IIT Kharagpur. Prasthanam's main goal is to encourage, nurture and showcase the various talented individuals, helping them reach their potential and realizing the hopes, dreams and aspirations of the seniors and alumni who have worked really hard to bring Prasthanam to where it is now.

It was foundedin 1967by Mr. R.K Bagrodia. Pravah comes under the Technology Students' Gymkhana and is a part of the Dramatics Subcommittee under the Social and Cultural Committee. Since its inception, Pravah has been highly successful in bringing the true spirit of theatre to life and in demonstrating the power of emotions and thoughts through its stage plays and nukkad nataks (Street Plays). The society although, does not hold any bias to a particular language anddoes not consider proficiency in Hindi as a metric during selections, which is evident from the fact that many of its members are not well versed in Hindi, but continue to contribute with great enthusiasm. The Pravah family, with 112 active members currently, boasts of individuals with a keen sense of theatrical and street art! Our members have also brought accolades to their halls with their performances in Hall dramatics and have featured in various Short Films for various productions by the Filmmaking club for Inter IIT Cultural Meets. Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/Pravaah Instagram :https://www.instagram.com/pravah_iitkgp/ Pravah auditions are held once per year, for the first years, in the first or second week of August for active membership for all four/five years. The society selects a batch of around 35 first years (UG/PG) at the beginning of the academic year soon after the welcome production. The selection procedure consists of tasks that judge voice modulation, intensity, speech and diction, confidence, and acting skills. It is not at all necessary that you must have a proper hold of Hindi, to be a part of Pravah. Also in rare cases, auditions have been held for a second time if it is found that a lot of people have missed the selections. Pravah has four governors appointed every year who govern the society and represent it in the Technology Student's Gymkhana. Training of freshers and overall co-ordination during productions, out-stations, and competitions are handled by the governors. Introductory Seminar(Welcome Production) The first act of the year (referred to as the Welcome Production ) is performed during late-July to Early-August.This introduces the first year to Pravah and it’s various activities. The freshers are given a thorough training of theatre oriented workshops that teaches them the basics of dramatics. Skills like voice modulation, voice intensity, dramatization, body posture, stage movements, third forms, etc are taught in groups. First years along with the four governors train for three weeks at the T.O.A.T. (Tagore Open Air Theater). Occasional skits, monologues, and challenging impromptu are attempted to improve the versatility of the actor. Both PG and UG's first years are welcome to take part in the workshop. Other than teaching the very basics of dramatics these workshops are also a great place to meet new people and interact with the seniors of Pravah. It is the first act performed by the freshers. It is performed during late-October to early-November. For its first production of the year Pravah generally picks up comical plays to entertain the freshers. The main objective of this play is for the first years to get an experience of what a play is and to provide them with a chance to display their newfound skills. Nukkad Natak is a form of art play whereas the actors perform on a street with a live audience. The purpose of Nukkad Natak is to spread awareness about important social/political issues that plague our society. Pravah participates in the nukkad natak event of Spring fest in the month of January. Only the first years participate in it and are guided by the seniors of society. Every year the members of Pravah participate in Rangmanch which is the stage play competition held during Spring fest in January.

        "content": "We surely feel proud when we enter IIT Kharagpur campus and look at the main building where it is written: Dedicated to the service of the nation. Indeed, there has been tremendous progress in the development of science and technology and IIT Kharagpur has remained devoted in this regard from its very inception. The world has reached to a point where people plan for ‘space travel’ or ‘Mars mission’. Today, medical science has developed so much that it can cure almost all diseases. The revolution in the field of information technology during the last couple of decades is easily noticeable. IIT Kharagpur is now recognized globally for serving all these fields. However, this has been only one face of development. While we live with all the comforts in the 2,100 acres campus of IIT Kharagpur, millions of people of India are struggling everyday to make their both ends meet. The recent NSSO data shows that 670 million Indians in rural areas live on Rs 33 per day. Unequal distribution of wealth has become more and more prominent with the fact that 10% of the population holds three quarters of India's wealth and 1% holds half of it. While the employment growth slowed to 0.3%, the slowest in four years, employment growth in the manufacturing companies plunged to (-)5.2% in 2014-15 from 3.2% in 2013-14. The news of farmer suicide is haunting us almost everyday. The society has remained trapped inside poverty, unemployment, corruption, caste oppression, violence against women, communal disturbances and so many. Surely, there has been a huge gap in the development of science and technology and its service to the society. With all these odds and with the concern for the society, the Science Education Group (SEG) was formed by the students of IIT Kharagpur in early 1980's. SEG involved itself in searching different dimensions connecting science and society. It actively took part in theoretical discussions and social practices to do justice to its quest for social and scientific knowledge. The group functioned till early 1990's. However, their rich experiences and the present time have inspired a group of students and professors to carry forward the banner of SEG. We believe that this campus acts as a sanctuary with all sorts of privileges and keeps us disconnected from the issues that affect the vast masses of people in India. Since, we proudly state that we are “dedicated to the service of the nation”, SEG thinks that it is our responsibility towards our nation to question and analyze the status quo to better serve the society. As written by Bhagat Singh “Any man who stands for progress has to criticize, disbelieve and challenge every item of the old faith”, SEG would like to act as a platform to study various scientific and social issues by holding sessions for discussions and debates. Objectives of SEG can be listed as follows: Hold sessions for discussions and debates on various scientific and social issues. Study, discuss and debate the thoughts of Bhagat Singh, Ambedkar and other progressive thinkers. Conduct various social welfare programs inside the campus or in nearby villages."

It empowers high-potential university students with practical skills, preparing them to become socially responsible, results-driven leaders who add value to both businesses and society. With a proven track record in international case competitions and hands-on experience across diverse sectors including technology, consulting, and sustainable development SHARE’s teams consistently deliver creative, effective, and actionable strategies that transcend conventional solutions. SHARE offers a comprehensive range of services, including the development of strategies for market entry, geographic expansion, and the identification of new market opportunities. The team conducts in-depth analysis of market trends and customer insights to design pricing strategies aligned with product value propositions. Additionally, SHARE supports clients by creating business plans, identifying potential investors, and crafting compelling pitch presentations. Their expertise also extends to data analytics, insight generation, and delivering tailored recommendation plans. SHARE conducts its recruitment process at the beginning of the autumn semester, which includes a group discussion followed by a personal interview. Candidates are evaluated not on their prior knowledge of consulting, strategy, or market research, but on their ability to think critically, approach problems logically, and communicate ideas clearly and coherently. The evaluation emphasizes structured thinking, analytical problem-solving, and a strong sense of commitment. SHARE seeks individuals who can manage their time effectively and demonstrate a high level of professionalism within the team. At SHARE, the primary mode of learning for first-year students is through knowledge meetings, where senior members lead sessions to introduce and explain essential consulting functions such as market research, strategy development, pricing analysis, and data-driven decision-making. These sessions not only facilitate learning but also foster active discussions and strengthen relationships between peers and senior members. SHARE further enhances experiential learning through intra-team competitions specifically designed for first-year students. These include a traditional case study challenge, an equity research report, and a distinctive event calledBid to Pitch. InBid to Pitch, participants begin by conceptualizing a startup idea and delivering a brief pitch to their peers. After the pitches, teams bid on the ideas they find most promising, effectively \"purchasing\" one to develop further. They then transform the chosen concept into a comprehensive, real-world business plan and deliver a final presentation that simulates an actual product or company launch. These initiatives are crafted to cultivate creativity, strategic thinking, and collaboration in a dynamic, hands-on environment. Case Study Competition: To develop critical thinking and business acumen, first-year students examine and offer strategic answers to real-world problems that businesses face. Bid to Pitch: In order to foster entrepreneurial thinking and valuation skills, participants bid on startup ideas and pitch business models, simulating investment decisions. Equity Research Report: Students gain experience with financial analysis and stock evaluation by creating expert-caliber equity research reports on publicly traded companies. Advisorsare the senior-most members of SHARE, typically in their fourth or fifth year. They draw upon their extensive experience to provide strategic guidance and help shape the overall direction of the organization. Presidentsare third-year students who lead and manage key projects across SHARE, ensuring that all initiatives are aligned with the organization’s goals and vision. Managers, in their second year, are responsible for executing project portfolios and overseeing daily operations.

It organises the annual Space Technology and Astronomy themed fest,National Students' Space Challenge[1](NSSC) every year since 2011.spAtsignites a passion for space exploration at IIT Kharagpur by organizing talks, discussions, stargazing sessions, lectures, and presentations. The group publishes a bi- semester newsletter, 'The Moonwalk', which features on latest ventures in space technology and astronomy related articles and developments.[2] The Space Technology Students' Society was founded way back in 2008 by a group of students extremely enthusiastic about the frontiers of space technology. It was formed as an official student body under the Kalpana Chawla Space Technology Cell (KCSTC). Since then, the society has grown in size and activities. The idea of a national level space-oriented fest was conceived and thus implemented as the National Students' Space Challenge (NSSC) in the year 2011. NSSC has been successfully organised for twelve more editions since then. A subgroup of spAts, the FQTQ team which is a dedicated Astronomy discussion group was formed in 2016 under the guidance of Siddhant Singh. The student body of spAts is divided into two subgroups - the core teams consisting of Design team, Tech team and Management team (which is more concerned with management and outreach) and the FQTQ team (which is more based on Astronomical discussions and applications). spAts organises sky-gazing sessions, space-themed discussions and talks, webinars, lectures, presentations and publishes the bi-semester newsletter, \"the moonwalk\" for the people in the IIT Kharagpur community. The teams also organise the National Students' Space Challenge during the months of September-October. spAts organises its selections during late August, once per year that is aimed only for the newly joining freshers for a continued membership till the end of the members' tenure. spAts organises an introductory seminar before the selections, where the functioning of the society as well as about NSSC is presented. The interested candidates join as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) who conduct the NSSC. For the JCoord team, the candidate's technological, management, communication skills etc. are considered. Later, selections for joining the spAts team happen, where interested candidates select one portfolio from the FQTQ team, Design team, Tech team and Management team where emphasis is given on prior knowledge in the specific portfolio, presentation skills, previous experience with the concerned technologies and knowledge in the fields of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Selections are done in three rounds, an initial interview, a task round and a final interview where the task submissions are reviewed. spAts is mainly comprised of its two subgroups - the Core teams and the FQTQ team. Each subgroup have their own undertaking tasks but mainly the whole team collectively organises the NSSC fest. These teams are mainly responsible for Management, Outreach, Communication, Publicity, Sponsor handling, Design, Web Design and Finance for the fest and the other activities spAts organises. The core teams consist of the Design team, the Tech team and the Management team FQTQ stands for From Quarks to Quasars, which describes the team more oriented to astrophysics in general. They hold periodic discussions and presentations on various topics along with sky-gazing events, open talks, webinars and content development. Conducting the fest remains a major task for the whole spAts team. The team structure is as follows - 5th and the 4th years comprise the Steering Committee (SCom) 2nd Years function as Sub-Heads for the various events First Years contribute as Junior Coordinators (JCoords) for the fest spAts organizes a lot of activities within the campus, as mentioned below. The spAts team interacts with the new coming Freshers batch during the Induction Programme through a series of presentations and workshops. In 2018, presentation on the life cycle of stars, the ever endless universe; and hand-on experience through water rocket lift-off workshop was conducted. The workshop received a positive response from the participants. National Students' Space Challenge TheNational Students' Space Challenge, abbreviated asNSSC, is an annual space-themed fest organised in the month of September-October since the year 2011. It is India's first and the largest space technology and Astronomy themed fest. The whole spAts team is indulged in organizing the fest. For more details find it on -NSSC spAts also works to popularize astronomy among the people in the KGP community. Hence it organizes sky-gazing sessions every semester and also to cover exciting astronomical events, like the super blood red moon 30th January, 2017. Every Year spAts observes the month of March as Space Month, where a series of open discussions, webinars quiz or presentations are held. This space month primarily aimed to bring and contribute towards recent developments in space technology. The Moonwalk is a bi-semester newsletter brought by the spAts team. It includes articles written on several astrophysical ideas, new perspectives arising in space and planetary sciences, recent developments in the field, contributions by eminent scientists over the world and discoveries. ↑\"Reaching for the stars\".

        "content": "TheStudent Welfare Group(SWG) is a student body under the office of the Dean of Students’ Affairs, IIT Kharagpur. It strives to be with those who need help and promises to sweat for the realization and solutions of issues faced by our fellow mates. It is an organization of the students, for the students, by the students. It functions as two teams: The Counselling Centre was set up in 2009 by the Dean Of Students′ Affairs, IIT Kharagpur as an outcome of his efforts to make the campus a better campus for the entire student community. It provided the students a place where they could easily approach with a problem and leave with a solution. The reach of the Counselling Centre was further extended through the Hall Coordinators Team. However, the increasing strength of students in the campus called for active participation from the students themselves in this cause. This was the scenario which saw the establishment of the Student Welfare Group in August 2011. Student Welfare Group was initially an idea that evolved out of a feeling to perpetuate and nurture a campus life which is hassle-free. Today, it is a dedicated group of students willing to sort out various issues of concern for the students. It plans to emerge as a more successful organization with more activities managed and implemented for the welfare of students. The aim of SWG is to ensure that every student's life in KGP is hassle free so that they can achieve their potential zenith while their stay in KGP as well as in their professional career. SWG aims to instil a belief in every student that they can achieve all their goals in life. SWG assists students in resolving their difficulties in every field, be it academic or extra-academic & curricular or co-curricular. It aims to create and sustain an environment that promotes personal growth and discovery, the pursuit of healthy minds and bodies, and participation in the creation of a caring community. This programme involves the guidance and mentorship of every single first year student by a 3rd or 4th year student of the same department. The objective of this programme is to help the first years understand the various aspects of college life, and adapt accordingly. This programme ensures that the hindsight of the Mentor becomes the foresight of the Mentee. The Mentees can benefit immensely from the insight of the Mentor and find the best possible way to utilize their time in the campus. The Student Mentor Programme provides scope for constructive and productive interaction between the freshmen and the experienced seniors, which forms an integral part of college life. An interactive session organized by the SWG for those who feel like they are lagging behind in the course because of no prior knowledge.Programming and Data Structuresis an important course of the first year curricula. The instructors are senior students of the institute who try to increase the problem tackling capability of the students, starting from the very basic level and build up their confidence to face the competition. In Friday’s sessions, tutorial sheets are provided to the students and the tutors help them to solve the questions by clearing the doubts of each and every student. In Sunday’s sessions, students are supposed to come with their laptops and they are given a set of programming questions like the ones given in PDS Laboratory classes. The tutors help the students in coding, compiling and running their programs. At the end of the sessions, the instructors also provide printed solution of the tutorial sheet to the students. Student Welfare Group in association with Smart Training Institute, a renowned organization for grooming and perfectingsoft skills, presents an opportunity to boost students' performance at group discussions and personal interviews just as the season for internships and placements begins. The workshop has been a success in the past with most of the students giving positive feedback. Since the collaboration with the private institute is in its early phase, there is a lot of room and scope in future. Taking into consideration the feedback, the SWG aims to provide better workshops in the following sessions. Panel Discussion (Wings Of Fire) Student Welfare Group organised a Panel Discussion by the batch of 2010-11. It invited students to open up to the valuable experience shared by the panelists in a discussion encompassing every facet of KGP life, including academics, extracurriculars, sports, societies and PORs. This discussion was very helpful for freshers who had just joined the institute. Panelists shared their vast experience of 4-5 years in KGP. Apart from freshers, a large number of 2nd and 3rd year students also gathered for this panel discussion. SWGpresentsForeSight, a program which provides the campus students a unique interface to connect with the people who have mastered their field and hence get a foresight of their future. It will cover various career related dimensions (placements, internships, FTs, competitions) from the students of the campus as well as alumni of the institute. A campus ride is being organized to acquaint freshers about the important places of the campus that a student needs to know. It begins from Technology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur (TSG). In 2015, more than 1200 freshers in 28 separate buses were shown the magnificence of the KGP campus with engaging interactions of SWG team with freshers. Information Brochure- A Walk Through For the first time in the history of our campus, printed version of Institute Information Brochure was circulated among all the freshers, thanks to the rigorous efforts of the SWG team and support of the administration. We hope it has helped the freshers batch a lot in their initial days here at KGP.

        "content": "TeamKARTis a group of students fromIIT Kharagpurwho like to explore the practical side of automobile engineering.TeamKART is officially a sponsored research project under the Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy Cell (SRIC) and the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur. The team designs, manufactures and tests Formula style prototype, single-seat race cars. It represents IIT Kharagpur at national and international Formula Student competitions,Formula Student, UKandFormula Bharat. The purpose of the group is to develop formula student race cars. Formula Student is widely regarded as one of the biggest and most challenging student-level engineering competitions in the world. It intends to give students a great learning experience across all domains of engineering industry: design, manufacturing, project management, financial management and business planning. The journey of each new car begins with its design. This involves application of all the classroom knowledge in actual engineering problems to achieve the set goals for the car and its different systems, through modelling, simulation and experimentation. The next challenge is to bring this design to reality, by checking the feasibility of various designs, fabricating different parts of the car through various manufacturing processes, and assembling them to the final stage. The last phase involves testing and tuning the systems of the car to rectify problems and achieve set targets. Supporting the car though this journey are the aspects of project management, cost planning,sponsorship and public relations. Effective project management is important to ensure that the entire production of the car, from designing, to manufacturng, to testing gets completed on time, and with positive outputs. Careful financial planning and management is required to ensure the best utilization of team's resources. Sponsorships are acquired from various industry partners to develop the team's resouce pool. Good public relations have to be maintained with various industry partners of the team, as well as with the team's supporters though meetings, social media and public events. As a part of one of the events in the competition, the team also develops a complete business plan to launch the car as a product in the market. This involves performing an in-depth case study and presenting a plan on the business strategy, finance, production and marketing of a race car start-up company. The activities of the group provide an all-round experience for its members to build a great skill set for themselves, and be a part of a team representing the institute at an international level. Its foundation was laid in 2008. It was an outcome of efforts of a few enthusiastic founding members and faculty advisers. The team took a solid form with the support of Prof. PP Chakraborty (Former Director, IIT Kharagpur) and Prof. Sunando Dasgupta (present Dean SRIC, IIT Kharagpur).Sidhartha Khastgirbecame the first Team Leader and stirred the team through the difficult initial stages where the team faced shortage of funds and technical knowledge.  Since then it has grown to become IIT Kharagpur’s largest student project encompassing around 70 students from 10 different departments. Ganesh Kumar M. became the second team leader and held responsibility for three years and oversaw the development of K-1 and K-2. Till date the team has successfully made five cars- the KX-1, the K-1, K-2, K-3 & K-4. K-2 competed at Formula Student UK 2013. Several design oversights in K2 were fixed in K-2.2 by a new chassis and intake-exhaust system; which competed at Formula Design Challenge 2015 (FSI 15). Formula Studentis Europe's most established educational motorsport competition, run by theInstitution of Mechanical Engineers(IMechE). Universities from across the globe are challenged to design and build a single-seat racing car in order to compete in static and dynamic events, which demonstrate their understanding and test the performance of the vehicle. The format of the event  is such that it provides an ideal opportunity for the students to demonstrate and improve their capabilities to deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment of a  motorsport competition. Formula Bharatis an engineering design competition in which students from colleges and universities all over India, compete with a life-size Formula-style vehicle in areas of engineering design, overall cost, marketability and dynamic performance. Being identical to the global student hosted in around eleven countries per year, the event encourages students to gain hands-on practical experience, while applying engineering theories studied in the classroom. It is hosted and managed by Mobility Engineering Consortium Pvt. Ltd., an organization dedicated towards hosting mobility-related competitions for students. The KX-1 was the team's first effort to build a car. The X' in the name stands for experiment as the car was the very first attempt of the completely novice team. The car was powered by aHonda CBR600RRengine which has hence forth powered all the cars till K-2.2. The team participated at Formula Student, UK 2010. The participation was however limited to static events. The team stood 9th in the cost report analysis, as the car was very cost effective in its design. The team was one of the six teams to be nominated for Airbus Teamwork Award. The K-1 was a major leap forward for the team. It was improved manifold from the first car. The car was powered by aHonda CBR600RRengine just like its predecessor. The team participated at Formula Student, UK 2011 with the car. However the team was restricted to participate only in the static events as the car had failed to clear the stringent scrutiny tests before the dynamic events. The team's impressive performance in the static events saw the team becoming one of the top three rookie teams at the event. The team again became one of the six teams to be nominated for the Airbus Teamwork Award. Tyre Specifications: 167/77 R 13 36 Q Material: Tubular Seamless Carbon Steel Suspension Type:SLA Double Wishbone Brake Details: Multi-Piston with brake biasing With a new car, theK-2, the team participated at Formula Student, UK 2013. The car was powered by a Honda CBR600RR engine just like its predecessors. There was significant improvement  in the car, a new plenum had been designed and manufactured in-house in rapid prototyping for better intake. New and more efficient SLA suspensions were implemented. It was the team's  most successful visit yet with the team clearing all the six scrutinizing inspections namely Tech, Safety, Chassis, Noise, Brake and Tilt, as per the rules & norms governed by theMSA(Motor Sport Association) andSAE(Society of Automotive Engineers). Out of the six Indian teams, TeamKART was one of the two teams to qualify for the dynamic events. The team competed in the endurance test. The team managed to secure 43rd position in Business Presentation and 45th in Cost and Sustainability Design Report and stood 67th overall among 120 participating teams.

The car was powered by a Honda CBR 600RR engine. A consequential improvement could be seen in the car. A new impact attenuator was added and the intake diffuser, throttle body and air filter had been changed. A new Scorpion Carbon fibre muffler, which was the first carbon fibre part of the car was also introduced. The size of the radiator fan had also been increased for better performance. The team participated inFormula Design Challenge2015 and passed technical scrutiny. Although a seized engine prevented the team from taking part in the dynamic events nonetheless it was a great learning experience for the whole team. The team bagged the first runners up position in both, the Business Presentation and the Cost Report.

Chain and sprocket based final drive system designed In order to keep up with the fast-paced action and innovations of the FSAE circuit, it is important that we work to better ourselves with every car that is manufactured. An innovative FS car should be sleek, light-weight, fast and efficient. Our latest car K4 checks off all those boxes, considering that it is one of the lightest and fastest cars we have manufactured since inception. It also boasts of several new upgrades that have added a sense of accomplishment to our car. K4 has a 3D printed (chemically welded) side intake which helped us to reduce the overall weight of the car. For the first time, K4 underwent dyno-tuning at a facility in Bengaluru which resulted in better power output and greater fuel efficiency. Eccentric differential mounts were installed which helped in chain tensioning and further reduced the weight. The acceleration and performance of the car improved as we successfully reduced the chassis weight by 10 kg as compared to our previous car K3. This was achieved with the proper usage of AISI 4130 mild steel over the AISI 1080 version. Moreover, extensive work into triangulation enabled us to design a smart and efficient structure. K4 has been made by implementing our Team’s first aerodynamic package element, the under-body diffuser.

TES is dedicated to the conservation and preservation of the environment, and to promoting sustainability in society. Its members are committed to raising awareness about ecology, nature, and the environment, and to sensitizing others to the importance of protecting our planet. Through a range of initiatives and activities, TES strives towards more sustainable future by finding solutions to environmental challenges and promoting conservation efforts within the campus and the wider community. TES aims to enhance and preserve the socio-ecological space within the IIT Kharagpur campus, with a focus on sustainability and community welfare. Although TES was officially institutionalized as a part of Gymkhana in 2021, its roots date back to 2018 when it was founded as Vision Prabaho by Biswarup Mondal, Sirsendu Sekhar Barman and Pragnaditya Malakar, who formed a team with other enthusiastic members. Vision Prabaho, the mother organization, is now registered as an NGO run by IIT Kharagpur alumni and other like-minded individuals. Our journey began when we met Mr. Tarak Chandra Paul, an environmentalist with an exceptional passion for green initiatives. We invited him to our IIT Kharagpur campus and organized awareness programs that received an overwhelming response from students, faculty, and campus residents. This enthusiasm motivated us to consider how we could contribute to building a better future. The team then embarked on various projects, campaigns, and initiatives to address environmental issues. We recognized the need to bring all stakeholders together under one umbrella for this common goal. The team was bolstered by the support of Prof. P. P. Chakraborty (Former Director, IIT Kharagpur), Prof. W. Mohanty (Gymkhana president), Prof. P. Patnaik, Late B.B. Rai (Senior Engg Horticulture section), and many other faculty members during our initial phases. Furthermore, the unwavering support from Ms. B. Chakraborty, Ms. A. Patnaik, and other campus residents tremendously helped us shape our idea. 3.2 Incorporation as a Gymkhana society Finally, TES was formalized as a full-fledged Gymkhana society in November 2021. Since then, it has grown steadily and is perhaps the first student organization in IIT dedicated to environmental issues.

The society used to publish the monthly wall magazineHang On, and the literary newsletterKGP Pulsebut they have been discontinued in favour of using social media to reach a larger population. TLS continues to publish the annual campus magazineAlankar. In the year 2014-15 a new event was introduced by TLS on the lines of aKavi Sammelan,christenedKavya Sandhya. The first edition was primarily experimental in nature, with the Hindi poets from Team TLS exhibiting their poetry and oratory skills on stage. the event received great admiration from thekavis in the campus and that motivated us to bring it in a larger scale as theKavyanjali. Kavya Sandhyais held till date in the autumn semester and gives a chance for the Hindi poets of the campus to dazzle the audience with their words. Continuing the legacy of Kavya Sandha, during the spring semester of year 2014-15 TLS collaborated withAwaazandRajbhasha Vibhagto organizeKavyanjaliin theKalidas auditoriumwhere acclaimed Hindi poets like Prof. Prem Shankar Tripathi, Shri Ravi Pratap Singh, Shri Jagesh Tiwari presided the event. Since then,Kavyanjaliis held annually in the spring semester where poets from outside and as well as inside the KGP campus enrapture the audience with their lines. In the year 2014-15, for the first time, TLS hosted a Poetry slam event during Spring fest. The event saw participation from 6 colleges and it was open for both Hindi and English poets. In the year 2018-19, for the first time, an English spoken word event calledFarragowas conducted. The event was held to promote the culture of English spoken word. The event saw participation from TLS members as well as some exceptional poets outside TLS from the campus. TLS regularly publishes content from itsFacebook page. Seeing the growing popularity of the social media platform Instagram, TLS also made its debut on Instagram and started regularly publishing from itsInstagram pagesince 2019. While the exact year is unknown, Technology Literary Society is believed to be founded sometime in the 50s[citation needed], along withHindi Technology Dramatics Societyin the same year which makes it one of the first societies in KGP. TLS was previously responsible for conducting KGP's literary fest, calledManzarand publishing the annual campus magazine,Alankar. Manzar was conducted in the week followingSpring Fest, another one of KGP's long standing traditions. But whenKshitijwas started in 2002, the time slots for Spring Fest andManzarwere merged, both being in the socio-cultural arena. In those days, SF did not conduct literary events. When the time slots for Manzar and SF were merged, logistical problems arose between SF and TLS teams, both competing for time slots and venues. Then TLS was broken in 2 parts, one responsible for Manzar to be merged with SF, another to be responsible for Alankar However, TLS kept the its tradition the same, keeping 9 Governors (which made sense while they had to conduct a fest). This was a period of decline for TLS as it had no responsibility other than to publishAlankarat the end of the year. However, it maintained its 9 Governors. In the year 2008, TLS came up with a new publication -Hang On, a monthly wall magazine which would be a satirical depiction of events around KGP and the world. Hang On was meant to be mostly humorous in nature while the more serious pieces were kept for ALANKAR. In 2009, TLS founded another bi-monthly publication -KGP Pulsewhich would frequent the more \"literary\" pursuits of its members and students from KGP but these were discontinued in 2016. In 2010, TLS for the first time started conducting events along with Spring Fest, which can be seen till date. In the same year, 2010, Alankar was not published due to Gymkhana budget constraints. It was, however, revived after a gap of 3 years in 2012 and since then has been published every year. From the year 2010-11, there have been only 4 Governors in TLS every year. There has also been a longstanding debate over what TLS stands for. While some within the team claim that it is to promote literary activities in the campus, some feel that it stands to promote the literary activities among the members. This has been reflected over the years in the change in leadership as each leadership team has their own version of the motive of TLS and acts accordingly. However, TLS has always stood by it's core principle and it's motto - helping KGP to express themselves! ↑https://web.archive.org/web/20150515065840/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies ↑https://web.archive.org/web/20131121043239/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies/tls ↑https://web.archive.org/web/20120912043025/http://www.gymkhana.iitkgp.ernet.in/societies/tls Pages using duplicate arguments in template calls All articles with unsourced statements Articles with unsourced statements"

        "content": "Technology Robotix Society(abbrv. TRS) is an official society under theTechnology Students' Gymkhana, IIT Kharagpur and is a focal point for activities and projects related toroboticsin the campus. With its reach expanding steadily each year, it has also cemented its position as one of the nerve centres of amateur robotics in India. Technology Robotix Society (TRS) conducts many events throughout the year, specifically aimed at undergraduate students, with a general aim of spreading robotics culture in the campus and around. The Kharagpur Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Group (KRAIG) classes are organized by TRS throughout the autumn semester each year and are open to be attended for all students. The main attendees being first year undergraduate students of the campus. The classes cover the basics of robotics, starting off with drives, mechanisms and then moving on to electronics, integrated circuits and finally to the basics of autonomous robotics. The annual winter workshop is conducted each year after the conclusion of the autumn semester. The workshops are mentored by second year robotics enthusiasts including TRS members and interested students are taught the concepts of either autonomous robotics or computer vision, and through that knowledge, attempt to tackle a relevant problem statement. Students are selected through a common test organized by TRS, based on the results of which problem statements and mentors are assigned to the students, which they try to tackle together in one week of time. Kharagpur Robotics and Intelligent Systems Seminars (abbrv. KRISS) is an initiative to bring together people across departments and different years to discuss and exchange ideas related to more mature and nuanced areas of robotics[which?]. The primary motivation is to encourage feedback and potential collaboration between interested individuals and also to foster a general culture of research-oriented discussions. In addition to the classes, TRS also organizes exclusively-for-freshers competitions likeRobosoccerin which students are taught to build a basic differential drive and Pathfinder workshop in which they are taught to build a line follower without writing a single line of code. In addition to all this, TRS also conducts workshops for robotics in other colleges in India. In the past numerous robotics projects have been initiated by Technology Robotix Society alumni, several of which have received independent funding and now have been converted to independent research groups in the campus. Presently, two research projects are being managed by TRS. They are the Quadrotor project and the Swarm project. Quadrotor is the unmanned aerial vehicle project taken up by Team Robotix, with the initiation taking place from the academic year 2014-15. The ultimate goal of the project is to participate and win in the I.A.R.C.(International Aerial Robotics Competition), which is a highly prestigious and contested global event with realistic and daunting problem statements. Swarm Robotics is a very rare project taken up by Team Robotix and there are very few labs which are dealing with swarm robotics in the country. The ultimate aim of this project is to enable a swarm of robots explore an unknown terrain. Makerspace is an initiative of Team Robotix for encouraging the students to come up with bright ideas for developing robots that could make a change. It is a community-based open source hardware hacking lab to make prototypes of selected hardware implementations as well as a meeting ground for open software projects. TRS aims to undertake small scale projects under this wing to make an everlasting impact on the IIT Kharagpur robotics scenario. Makerspace Projects that have been completed till date include the 2D PLOTTER(A mini version which can print any graphic having size less than 120 * 240 mm), Automated Inventory Management, Self Learning Crawling Robot and the Inter-IIT TCTD challenge. Projects that have been undertaken and are in progress : QUADRUPED: The basic aim is to build a quadruped equipped with 4 wheels that moves using wheels on plane surfaces and uses its legs to climb stairs/ uneven surfaces. ROBOTIC ARM:  To build a 5 degree-of-freedom robotic arm by 3 D printing the basic chassis and using servos, is the primary objective. The arm can then be used for a variety of research purposes. The annual fest Robotix, conducted each year during Kshitij is the focal activity of the society in a year. With a footfall of over 2000 each year, it has turned into the largest single robotics based annual agglomeration in South Asia.[unverified] Events during Robotix are conducted under three categories: manual, autonomous and programming/online. In the manual events, the participant handles the robot by using a remote control. The remote system may be wired or unwired. The robot then has to perform the specified task, which is usually something mechanical. In the autonomous events, the robots act independently; participants are not allowed to control them during their run. These robots typically use programmed micro-controllers to make decisions. Some events involve more than one robot, and can be a mix of autonomous and manually controlled robots. In the programming events, the participants are given a problem statement and submit code to solve the problem; the competitors are also allowed to submit their solutions online. Robotix 2019 was held from 18-20 January, 2019. In this edition of the fest, the events held were: Zenith: Build a manually controlled robot which is capable of crossing the gaps in the arena, while avoiding obstacles by increasing or decreasing its ground clearance.

There was no restriction on the number of robots one could build, but at least one robot must be autonomous. 8MileX: The autonomous robots travel outdoors on an actual road and follow traffic rules. It is similar to the Robotix 2009 8 Mile event, and is a scaled down version of theDARPA Grand Challenge. TribotX Championship: A three-tier tournament that required participants to use their manually-controlled robots to perform three tasks over three days of the festival. The teams with the highest cumulative scores after the first two tasks advanced to final knockout stage. The tasks were selected from a pool of modules. Contestants were then informed of the day's task 12 hours before the start. eXplore: In the underwater event, the manually-controlled robots dive and release several light weight balls held at different coordinates in a large water tank. The robots then collect the balls that are floating on the surface and bring them to the designed area of the arena called the victory zone. Xants: The programming/online event that is inspired byant coloniesand the principles ofswarm intelligenceandcollective intelligence. In a simulation of an ant colony and several energy packets distributed across the arena, where individual ants cannot sense beyond a certain range, and can only leave a scent trail for other ants to follow, participants had todesign an algorithm to optimize this coordinationand to procure the energy packets efficiently. Robotix 2009 was held from 29 January – 1 February 2009, featuring the following events: 8 Mile: The autonomous battery-powered vehicles traverse the road, and must follow traffic rules from traffic lights to zebra crossings. 12 Doors Down: The autonomous robot is placed in a labyrinth of cells. The participants use a manually controlled robot to guide it out of the grid by opening and closing doors. Micro Mouse 4D: In the programming/online event, participants code a function in a pre-programmed template to run a simulation to address themicro-mouserobotics problem. It was simulated withMicrosoft Robotics Studio. FramED9211: In the programming/online event that involvesimage processing, participants submit a code in a language of their choice torecognize the number platesof fast moving cars among all cars in a real life video. wEDGED: The event was inspired byNintendoplatform games. The manually controlled robots climb a wooden wedge while they avoid the swinging pendulums. They grab a plank by its handle and swing on to a lower platform. It was a one-on-one competition. #mEsh: The manually controlled robot climbs up and down an inclined metallic mesh. The size of a unit square of mesh is 7 cm x 7 cm. Robotix 2008 was held from 31 January – 3 February 2008. It featured the following events, two of which were not disclosed beforehand: I.M.A.G.E.[expand acronym]: A autonomous robot, with the help of maximum two cameras, navigates the arena while avoiding obstacles, in order to pass various checkpoints and reach the end point. Robo-Relay: Two autonomous robots traverse an irregular track while carrying a baton. The robots are synchronized so that they pass the baton and run one after the other. On Spot Robotics (Autonomous): This was an undisclosed event where the participants build an autonomous robot that only uses logic gate circuits (i.e. no microcontrollers). Stackistics: The manually controlled robot assembles blocks of various pre-specified shapes and sizes to form a given spatial structure. Terra Ranger: The manually controlled robot travels on varied land terrains and also water surfaces. On Spot robotics (Manual): This was an undisclosed event where the task was to build a manually controlled robot and controller to fulfill the requirement of the problem statement. Mission Mars: In the programming event, the participants code robot ants which coordinate among themselves during their mission to explore an area. Robotix 2007 was held from 1–4 February 2007. It featured the following events: Rail Track Inspector: The automated robot follows two parallel white lines, 5 cm apart, on a black blackground, and reports any errors it encounters. The errors were of two types. First, it reports when the distance between the lines is different from their specified gap. Second, it reports if either of the white lines are discontinuous. The errors must be classified separately. Grid Navigator: The autonomous robots move in an 8-foot square maze and detect the positions of obstacles placed in the maze without dislocating them. The maze is in the form of a two dimensional numbered grid. Squares are marked with white lines on a black background. The robot starts in  one corner of the maze and exits on the diagonally-opposite corner after identifying all the obstacles. The robot is free to roam in the grid in any given way. Mission Mars: A repeat of the previous year's event. In this programming/online event, the participants write code to control robot ants on a simulated Martian surface, so that it can cover the maximum area in a given time. Multiple instances of the same program were run at the same time, with each instance able to communicate with the others to prevent collisions which would render both robots extinct. The participants were allowed to code inC,C++orJava. Jigsaw: In this programming/online event, the participants write code to solve a jumbled up picture. The picture is broken into fragments and is scrambled by using a program. Only the top left corner of the jumbled picture is the same as the original picture. The participants code in either C or C++. Load runner: The manually controlled robot uses a hooking mechanism to attach freights and link them together to form a train. It then has to act as  the engine of the same train and pull it to its destination. Use of magnetic material to attach to the freights is prohibited. Step climber: The manually controlled robot climbs up and down a flight of stairs. The height of the steps varies. Robotix 2006 was held from 2–5 February 2006. It featured the following events: Distance Tracker: The autonomous robot travels a certain path and reports the distance traversed in a digital format. The paths varied from a simple circle to an arbitrary route. Match Maker: The autonomous robot moves white blocks placed in the arena to regions of their corresponding shape. Mission Mars: In the programming/online event, participants code robot ants to cover as much area of the Martian surface within a given time. Top-sy Turvy: The manually controlled robot takes balls at different heights and surfaces, and throw thems in a goal post within a limited time. Water Polo: The manually controlled robot races on a water surface to place five balls inside a certain goal post in the fastest time.

        "content": "Telugu Cultural Association promotes Telugu culture at the KGP campus. It is the most prominent cultural association in the IIT KGP and performs its activities so that the people can savor the brilliance of Telugu culture, arts, and cuisines. TCA gathers all the Telugu people in one place, strengthening solid social bonds and creating an environment for the preservation and growth of Telugu culture Kharagpur has been historically known by the alias “Second Andhra” because of the Telugu diaspora from then Andhra Pradesh settling at Kharagpur for Railway jobs and IITKGP being the first premiere institute of the Nation. TCA was founded in the 1960s by Telugu professors to celebrate Telugu festivals and uphold a culture far from home. The body used to function as an association wherein funds were raised amongst the professors to organize traditional events and festival celebrations. As time progressed, in the '90s, students residing on campus began attending the events and participated in a few. By the early 2000s, there was harmony between the students, faculty, and staff bodies. Due to the rising internet culture, the advent of social media, and the ever-growing number of students from the Telugu States, students have become an integral part of the association since 2012. To cater to this, a separate section of the association was formed in October 2023, now known as the Students’ Telugu Cultural Association. Students’ TCA aims to build a community that promotes Telugu culture and unites people to celebrate our rich heritage and share our love for our language, music, dance, and art. This is done by organizing the plethora of events celebrated in the Telugu states. Though times change and new trends kick into the Gen-Z population, we believe in a Culture-holistic approach to organize events and maintain a home-like environment for the Telugu junta. The heads are called “Joint Secretaries” and are 4 in number. They are usually 4th year undergraduate students. One of them must be a female undergraduate student pursuing a dual-degree course at IITKGP. A new post was introduced in 2023 Spring when TCA was restarted by a group of 5th-year Telugu undergraduate students, headed byKumidhini Kesana, who then became the “Governor” of TCA. According to the constitution drafted by the succeeding team, the position of Governor will be discontinued from the 2025 Autumn semester. The rest of the crew includes third--, second-, and first-year students, termed “Members” of the association. Finally, an advisory board is nominated by the faculty edition of TCA consisting of two professors or staff to guide and advise the student body, formalize the proceedings of every event thus acting as a bridge between STCA and TCA. Telugu Cultural Association has organized festival celebrations such as Bhogi, Sankranthi, FETE, Ugadi, Sri Rama Navami, Vinayaka Chavithi, and Cultural Night. STCA decided to take it a step further and develop the association into a community addressing all the sociocultural aspects of the Telugu junta. These include but are not limited to: TCA has conducted guest talks with eminent spiritual personalities in Telugu, such as Chinna Jeeyar Swamy Chaganti Koteswara Rao. STCA has taken it a step further to host a guest talk by Padmasri Awardee Dr. Garikipati Narasimharao on topics ranging from dealing with academic stress to adopting an ideal student lifestyle. TCA has been operating itsYouTube channelsince 2011, and music and dance performances during the events are uploaded. The responses have been tremendous, with over 50,000 subscribers, 340 videos, and 20M+ views. Several Sankranthi and Ugadi celebration clippings have been in local Bengali and regional Telugu newspapers such asEenadu. A Popular Telugu production house and social media content team, “Chai Bisket,” has featured TCA on “15 Rocking “College Dance Performances” on YouTube, which is worth a watch.” The newInstagram page, launched in April 2023, has quickly gained the attraction of many, with 90,000+ impressions and a solid interaction rate. The posters, event teasers, and after-movie videos have gained great appreciation from the Telugu junta for their quirky editing and excellent quality.

        "content": "+91 74393 04962 (Saharsh Agrawal) +91 99032 50289 (Ayandeep Neogi) The KGPian Game Theory Society,abbreviated asKGTS,is IIT Kharagpur’s game theory organisation. It is a dynamic and intellectually stimulating community for students passionate about the study and application of game theory. It had organised various game theory-related events likeNashify,War of Wits, Brethren of the Coast and Finance Talk in previous years, designed to promote a culture of game theory on the campus. The Society’s flagship event is Stratathon, a mind-intriguing strategy case competition featured inKshitij, the Techno-Management fest of IIT Kharagpur, every year. TheKGPian Game Theory Societywas founded on 19th August 2010 byManoj Gadia (07-12). It is a student body which organizes variousGame Theoryrelated programs. With a motive of spreading awareness, knowledge and application of Game Theory, first official session of society was 15th June 2011 to 14th June 2012. Since then the society has seen tremendous growth over the years and witnessed good response from students and game theory enthusiasts. By the able guidance and vision of it's founder Manoj Gadia, this society has grown to become a family with more than 50 members. The Society was founded with a main motive to promote concepts of Game Theory and Strategic Thinking. Many situations in people's lives make them choose between different options and we always intend to optimize our chances and get the best outcome. This is where Game Theory comes into play. The outcomes decided by the situations provoke us to analyze them statistically and hence choose the optimal solution through various methods and statistics. This society promotes these concepts by various means. This project is started under the advice of Prof. Avinash Dixit, emeritus professor of Princeton University. Society members undergo this self-learning program throughout the year to develop their strategic thinking skills. The Society also makes original questions based on strategic decision-making to compile it as a question bank. In discussion sessions, senior members conduct discussion sessions for all the members, explaining the various theoretical concepts, along with interesting games and real-life examples. Society members practice solving case studies using game theory in our academic meetings. Senior members solve real life case studies in the fields of business and economics. In society meetings, members play strategy-based games among themselves to learn how to use game theory concepts in a given situation. The games are usually in accordance with the concepts being covered during discussion sessions. It is an annual on-spot strategy based competition for students of IIT Kharagpur. The first edition WOW 1.0 was held on Saturday, 30th March 2013 in association with Consulting Club, Vinod Gupta School of Management. More than 300 students participated in the event. The 2nd edition WOW 2.0 was organized on 3rd April 2015 and witnessed a participation of more than 350 students. WOW has been increasingly attracting a good amount of participation from the in-campus students of IIT Kharagpur. It is the first of its kind game theory based on-spot inter-college event designed and conducted by the The KGPian Game Theory Society inKshitij2014, the annual techno-management fest of IIT Kharagpur. Drawing from the success of the in-house event War of Wits, Nashify challenged the participants to outwit and outplay their opponents. The event took place on 1st and 2nd February 2014 and saw a participation from 146 teams (438 participants). It is the flagship event of KGTS, which is conducted every year, during Kshitij, IIT Kharagpur. It includes various in-house developed strategic decision-making games, played in various rounds and formats, among the students of colleges from all over India. This was one of its kind online event based on Strategic Thinking. It was based on the Classical Game of Pirates dealing with the distribution of 100 coins with interactive Graphical User Interface. It was a 1 week-long event which started on 25th October 2013 and witnessed a participation of more than 1500 students. The game was designed and developed by Sreejith PP and Rishi Mehta in collaboration with Team KGTS. Sessions have been conducted for the students in the past where they were introduced to the basics of game theory and were involved in taking decisions in certain situations that were simulations of real-life scenarios. On 31st March 2012, society conducted a finance talk where final year students who happened to have cleared one or more levels of the prestigious exams of CFA, FRM and CAT were called as guests to share their experiences. The seminar saw a huge participation of around 400 students It is a periodic newsletter which contains articles that are specially designed to target the in-campus students of IIT Kharagpur having articles and facts ranging to various fields such as leadership, finance, consultancy, and business management. Debut edition was published in April 2012 and had the highest online viewership for any newsletter in IIT Kharagpur till date. Since then society has released 7 editions of The Strategist, which have had the highest viewership in the respective semesters. Society coordinate with Economics Club IIT Delhi and share articles and ideas based on game theory.The Strategistcould be read online at:http://issuu.com/the.kgts. Society design comic strips to provide an interesting overview of Game Theory with a fun touch. With a maximum online reach of over 16000, these comic strips attract wide sections of viewers.

Quite a number of issues in, The Scholars' Avenue raised the issue of the condition of the B. C. Roy hospital and reported about a strike within campus. Amidst misunderstandings, major decisions were made which included a ban on the Scholars' Avenue and curtailment of its website. The ban lasted less than a month and TSA decided to no longer stay under the Gymkhana – a move that made it free to decide its content but also left it financially crippled. The Scholars' Avenue also has a large readership on their website where news is not the only thing that gets published. They also do a number of articles on different genres as listed below.

The society aims at spreading diverse music genres, nurturing and motivating musicians, inculcating values and expression through music, and develop good music taste among our audience. WTMS selection auditions are held at least once in a year, in the autumn semester (sometimes happen in the spring semester too, depending on requirement), for all students (UG/PG), around the month of August/September. Selection procedure generally consist of two rounds, where the first round is a preliminary screening round to assess basic musical ability, comfort with the instrument (or singing), basic knowledge, and screened candidates are invited to give a second round of auditions where they are given few (2-3) songs to prepare. For instrumentalists, the songs that are decided are generally same for everyone, and they are chosen such that they cover a diverse spectrum of techniques/skills in the particular instrument, and for vocalists, the songs are given on the basis of the pitch range and the singer's tonality. There is generally a gap of 3-4 days between both rounds of the auditions. WTMS has three governors selected by the society seniors every year who govern the society and represent it in Gymkhana. Overall co-ordination during practices, productions and competitions are handled by the governors. The primary activities of the society include organizing and performing two productions every academic year, one in the Autumn Semester and the other in Spring Semester. The playlist is decided few weeks prior to the production through a consensus of all the members in the society. Songs are chosen so that the playlist is as diverse as possible, consisting of (but not limited to) genres such as Rock (Progressive/Post/Classic/Psychadelic), Metal(Thrash/Prog/Core), Jazz, Blues, Funk, Neo-soul, R&B. WTMS performs the annual production in the autumn semester generally in the month of October/November around the Durga Puja vacations. This is also the first time the new inductees get the chance to perform for the society. WTMS performs the spring production in the spring semester generally in the month of March, after the end-semester examinations, around the time when Hall Days are going on. This happens to be the final production of the graduating batch and they get a chance to play some of their favourite songs for one last time in KGP."

        "content": "From the THIRD semester onwards the curriculum offers scope for a student to opt for Additional subjects apart from the regular curriculum. Following conditions are to be met for Additional Credits: If a student has a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) equal to or greater than 7.50 without any backlog, he/she would be allowed to take additional subjects within and/or outside his/her own discipline to earn additional credits of up to 33% of his/her requirement for major. A student would be allowed to register in an additional subject only if he/she satisfies the pre-requisite, there is no clash in the timetable and the class size permits. Once a student has registered in an additional subject, the grade obtained (including F-grade) in that subject would invariably be recorded in his/her grade card. The credit contribution of these additional subjects to the computation of CGPA, however, would be considered as nil. The GPA of the additional subjects is separately calculated and indicated in the grade card. A student can drop an additional subject following the proper procedure within 3(three) weeks from the commencement of the semester; otherwise, the subject will remain registered and the subject will be mandatorily reflected on the Grade Card even with F grade. There is no scope for a supplementary examination in an additional subject. Student can getMinorfrom other departments by completing required number of credits and full filling the requirements. Micro-Credit courses are one credit courses having duration of 3‐14 days offered during the semester or during evening or free slots available during weekdays or even weekends that are not declared holidays in some special cases when students are available. The subject will be counted for total credit requirement for completion of degree in special cases subject to recommendation of the Head and approval of Dean (UGS) with due reasons recorded. The subject and grade will be mentioned in transcript / grade card and will be used to compute CGPA for additional subjects and will be shown as ACGPA. Failures will be marked by F grade. There will be no supplementary examination for such subjects. The F grade will be changed only if the subject is offered again and the student is allowed to register and clear the subject. However, in case the micro-credit is accepted as a subject contributing to the curricular requirement, it will be accounted for in the CGPA calculations. A student is normally not expected to take more than 2 such courses in a semester. The subject may also be a part of minor and micro‐specialization."

Skillcombo.com- Deep Learning online courses List of Interesting Blogs and Communities Deep Learning enthusiasts on Twitter Michael A. Nielsen, \"Neural Networks and Deep Learning\", Determination Press, 2015 Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a particular way of framing the learning problem, so that instead of being given labels about which option is correct in any given situation (as in supervised learning), you only have a single scalar \"reward\" signal which you are trying to maximise[1]. For example, to learn to play chess, if you knew the best move in every situation, you could train a supervised learning (SL) system with these ground-truth labels. If you only have an entire game followed by a win/loss binary signal, you could use reinforcement learning to learn to play in such a way that wins are maximised. Thus RL is more generally applicable than SL. For example,AlphaGowas trained to play the board game of Go in this way, beating the world champion in aspectacular televised match. Deep Reinforcement Learning(Deep RL) combines reinforcement learning with deep learning, using deep neural networks to learn directly from raw inputs, without hand-engineered features or domain-specific heuristics. In 2013 DeepMind arguably kicked off the growth of the field by showing impressive results using Deep RL toplay Atari video games. Spinning Up in Deep RL by OpenAI Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with David Silver Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. Book by Andrew Barto and Richard S.

It will not be permissible to alter the choices after the application has been submitted. Change of branch shall be made strictly on the basis of inter se merit of the applicants. For this purpose the CGPA obtained at the end of the Second (Spring) Semester shall be considered. Ties will be broken by the JEE Advanced rank of the applicants. In making the change of branch, those applicants shall be first considered who have secured a rank within top 1% (one percent), rounded to the nearest integer, amongst all the first year students in terms of the CGPA scored at the end of the Second (Spring) Semester. Change of branch requested for by such applicants shall be made without any constraint on the number of seats. The remaining applicants may be allowed a change of branch, strictly in order of inter se merit, subject to the limitation that the actual number of students in the Third (Autumn) Semester, in the branch to which the transfer is to be made, does not exceed 110% of the sanctioned yearly intake for that branch. The sanctioned yearly intake of a particular branch shall be the number sanctioned by the Senate as the intake for that branch for the particular year of entry of the applicants. To compute the total number of students in the first year, sum of the sanctioned yearly intake of all the branches will be taken. For the purpose of calculating the actual number of students in a particular branch, the number of students joining the branch is to be considered. The academic section will notify the students and display on the notice boards about the changes of the branch at least 7 (seven) days before the assigned date(s) of the registration of the third (Autumn) semester. However, all changes of branch made in accordance with the above rules will be effective from the Third (Autumn) Semester of the applicants concerned. No changes of branch shall be permitted thereafter. All changes of branch will be final and binding on the applicants. No student will be permitted, under any circumstances, to refuse the change of branch offered. Notwithstanding the provisions of foregoing paragraphs, the Senate may under very special circumstances, permit the transfer of a student from one branch to another in deviation of the above mentioned rules. In each such case the special reasons for which the transfer is permitted must be recorded in the Senate resolution. Such transfers, if any, will be over and above the regular transfers, and their number will not be counted in the computation of ‘Actual Number of Students’ in a given branch. ↑https://erp.iitkgp.ernet.in/regulation_UG_corrected.pdf"

Micro Specialization Components Each Micro-Specialization has a defined structure in terms of three sequential components:Component-I – One Foundation Course (2-4 credits) that constitutes a Mandatory Requirement and also a Pre-Requisite for subsequent Components.Component-II- One/Two subjects (3-4 credits each) from a Specified list of subjects.Component-III- Project/Design/Term Paper (4 credits) OR one subject (4 credits) from a Specified list. Component-I – One Foundation Course (2-4 credits) that constitutes a Mandatory Requirement and also a Pre-Requisite for subsequent Components. Component-II- One/Two subjects (3-4 credits each) from a Specified list of subjects. Component-III- Project/Design/Term Paper (4 credits) OR one subject (4 credits) from a Specified list. A Student would be required to complete 3-4 subjects (10-14 credits) from the specified list in order to earn a Micro-Specialization. The subjects can be taken through the Breadth/Open Elective component of the curriculum or as Additional Subjects. If specified in the Micro-Specialization curriculum, the subject can also be taken as Micro-Credit/s. A student has to register for a Micro-Specialization. The Registration can be done at the beginning of any Semester beyond the first year. In order to register for a Micro-Specialization, the student must have completed all curricular requirements upto the previous semester and have a CGPA ≥ 7.0. Thereafter the student must maintain a CGPA or SGPA ≥ 7.5 without any Backlog in the subsequent semesters to keep the Micro-Specialization registration active. GPA for the subjects contributing to the Micro-Specialization will be separately calculated. A minimum GPA of 6.00 is essential to earn the Micro-Specialization."

The subjects would be a combination of mostly core and some electives. Students aspiring for a Minor in a discipline must register for the same in the beginning of the 5th semester. Only those students, who have a CGPA of 7.5 or above, without any Backlog, will be permitted to register for a Minor. An SGPA or CGPA in excess of 8.0 has to be maintained in the subsequent semesters without any Backlog in order to keep the Minor registration active. Should both the SGPA and CGPA fall below 8.0 at any point after registering for the minor; the Minor registration will cease to be active. A student registered for Minor in a discipline must register and pass in all subjects that constitute the requirement for a minor and score a minimum grade point average of 6.00 to be awarded a Minor in that discipline. A student may cover these six subjects as either a depth subject, elective subject or a breadth subject or as additional credits. However, he/she has to take at least three subjects as additional credits to earn a minor. Students enrolled in Dual Degree, Integrated M.Sc. and B.Arch.

What was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Case Interview + Behavioural/ Experience Interview ​(The second one I'd say is a little different from the regular HR interviews- the focus is upon your learnings and getting to know you more personally, things which aren't on resume, something which might be there in your SOP)​ The first 2 rounds were guesstimates with extrapolated case questions, i.e. candidate is expected to give some inference with respect to the number obtained. Guesstimate 1:Size of pre-schools in India Guesstimate 2:Annual revenue of one BCG India office The next 2 rounds were strategic and subjective case questions with no numbers involved.​ Candidate is expected to go about addressing the case in a structured manner. It's more than possible that one may miss a few points, and the interviewer will also be cool with it as long as the approach is structured. The guessing game is fragile and easily gets caught. Moreover, the interviewer would never help and instead would prod more if he/ she realizes that random arrows are being shot wildly in the sky. The last round (Partner round) was Data Interpretation in my case from the regular consult slides (something similar to the Capital One test)- familiarity with DI would hence certainly help. A candid and cheerful approach is very very helpful. Afterall, these companies want individuals with whom they want to work with. Having said that, there is a very thin line between candid and cocky (excuse for the language). Do bear that in mind. What are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? Tell me something about yourself. Walk me through your resume. Resume grilling. The most challenging environment/ work etc.\nWhy consulting? Why the firm? Why you? This could be a long list and can be googled up as well. The idea is to sell yourself in all/ most of the answers.

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Consulting companies primarily gauge how “client safe” you are. One’s case solving acumen is tested apart from how comfortably you can interact with the interviewer and strike up a conversation with him/her. For consulting companies the interview is preceded by a buddy session wherein each shortlisted student is assigned a buddy (a person working at the firm). The buddy aids you in your preparation (feel free to ask him/her all your doubts and practice as many cases as possible with your buddy).In some companies the buddy process is evaluative. There are mainly 2 components to an interview: Case and HR. The case given to you will be a real life case that your interviewer has worked on. Always remember the interviewer is just assessing your thinking process. The answer isn’t too important to him. Also, it’s really important to be good with numbers for quantitative cases. Since we are from an engineering background, a lot of focus is given to numbers cases by the companies. In the HR component you are asked questions on your resume. The interviewer is mainly interested in what you have learnt from a particular experience or the impact you were able to create etc. They generally don’t get into the technical aspects of your internships. You can expect atleast one case (or guesstimate) derived from your own personal experiences. This is normally asked to assess how well you can apply knowledge gained through your own experiences to a case. Eg. I stay in Bombay so I was asked to estimate the amount of toll collected on the Bandra-Worli Sealink in a day. You can expect anywhere between 3-6 rounds depending on the company. The final interview rounds are with the partners of the firm. What are things students can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector.? The first stage in applying to a consulting company is submission of your CV and cover letter. So in the vacations you can focus on making your CV. Consulting companies are looking for candidates with a spike in their profile (it can be in sports, PORs, internships, cultural activities, etc.) along with a good academic record. Students can start case prep from August and HR prep around 10 days before the interview. Also, you should be absolutely thorough with your resume. The main focus of students should be on case solving. It is highly recommended that students form case groups among themselves (I’d recommend 3 students in one case group). I’ve generally observed that how students perform in an interview depends on the combined efforts of the entire group and coordination in the group. It’s your entire case group that’s going to correct your mistakes and help you prepare for the interview and not just the individual efforts put in by you. So make sure you choose your case group wisely. Next for case prep, students should start with the Victor Cheng videos and then move on to the IIT Bombay casebook. Other sources that can be referred to after this are: IIM-A casebook, ISB casebook, Case in Point, Kellogg Casebook and HBS Casebook. Your focus should not be on solving a huge number of cases. It’s not the quantity of cases you’ve solved that matters but the quality of your preparation that makes the difference. Also, try to solve as many cases as possible with people in the consulting industry and not just your buddies. The feedback you get from them goes a long way in helping you prepare. It’s important you develop a systematic thinking process while solving cases. MECE (Mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive) is one such technique. You will come across a lot of frameworks to solve cases during your preparation. My suggestion is to come up with your own case framework along with your case group. That really helped me in my interviews. Coming up with your own framework is a slow and steady process. As you keep solving cases and come across different frameworks, keep building your own framework. I kept refining my framework as I solved more and more cases. A frequently asked question is how much focus should be laid on guesstimates. Guesstimates are generally asked in market sizing questions. Students should regularly practice guesstimates as well though not as much as cases.

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. The interview process involves multiple levels of interviews. The initial rounds can be over telephone, Skype or in person subject to the company's preference. They were all case interviews - designed to test our basic business case/problem solving abilities. Some of them might involve a few questions related to HR and they can be particularly detrimental, given Consults' problems tackling high attrition. What are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? Tell me about yourself? Why consulting? Where do you see yourself 5/10 years later? What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? Mention one of your failures? Questions on being a team player, leader, displaying ownership, creativity and initiatives - CV specific. What are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Be extremely good at what you do. Be it Finance, Banking, Consulting, Sports, Academics or Research! Diversify if possible to justify that you are game for consulting given a different background. Work on communication and networking skills. English. In most cases, you don't work towards becoming a consultant, you just get cherry picked because of whatever you're good at. Case Interviews Video Lectures by Victor Cheng, Case Interviews Cracked from IIT Bombay, IIM A casebook Software Development/Coding/Quant Manav Kedia - Offers from Goldman Sachs, VISA, Microsoft; PPOs from Adobe, Codenation What was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Each company has its own online test, usually on Hackerrank consisting of 3-4 coding questions and/or MCQ's from Computer Science domain. After you qualify this round and are shortlisted for the interview, usually for all the SDE positions, the general process consists of 2-3 technical rounds followed by 1 HR round. Some companies like Microsoft may even have a group fly round for all of its shortlisted candidates. In the technical rounds, they ask you 2-3 coding questions which you have to code on paper(proper syntax and everything, not pseudo code) and/or domain related questions from DBMS, Networks, OS and ML(if mentioned in the resume). In the HR round they ask you the typical HR questions such as why do you want to join our company, do a SWAT analysis, what are your long term and short term interests. One should also prepare his/her answers for the HR round and not just for the technical rounds. What are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? Preparing for the typical HR questions is a must in my opinion. Other than that you should have \"introduce yourself\" prepared and oriented to the company position that you are applying to. This was something that almost every interviewer asks before beginning. Another question that they usually ask you is to explain one of the projects that you have worked on with a little detail. Be sure to go through your resume very well and have something prepared for every project/ achievement that you have written on your resume. What are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Strengthen your fundamentals in the core CS subjects such as DBMS, ML(if you have mentioned it in your resume), Networks and OS. Practise competitive programming regularly on sites such as codeforces, codechef. Take up projects. Setup a profile on Github, push your projects there. geeksforgeeks.com (Algorithms and data structures part are a must) topcoder tutorials on advanced topics such as binary indexed trees, suffix arrays, segment trees (important for google) Do practise on interviewbit.com, it helps to handle the corner test cases Abhijeet Raj - Placed at Goldman Sachs What was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. There are two types of quant, first one is of the cat format which can be mastered by practicing any of the materials available for CAT exams. The second one is of different kind. It requires you to deal with basic probability, theory of expectation and brain storming. The companies i interviewed for were of the second type. They ask you questions related to probability and expectation numbers. For analytics they check whether you know the basic and business concepts behind all the analytics work you have written in your CV. What are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? The most important FAQ is to decide which sector you want to land up into. You should never aim for 200+ companies rather aim for 10 companies based upon your area of interest and start preparing for them. Another important thing to remember is that the placement semester is not for analyzing what you haven't done rather think about what you have done and how can you make that your selling point. If you have an answer for these two questions you are ready for placements What are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? Study the basics of probability and statistics. Go through first 4-5 chapters of Jain and Iyengar. Learn the basics of machine learning and practice it by participating in various competitions held online. Try and get an internship in this sector. 1. Hines for probability and statistics. 2. Intro to machine learning by Andrew NG(Coursera) 3. Applied multivariate statistical modelling by J Maiti(NPTEL) 4. 50 challenging problems in probability by Frederick Mosteller 1. Introduction to algorithms by OCW, MIT 4. Stanford Core NLP on coursera 1. Read various answers on Quora for machine learning and Data scientist 2. Online blogs for successful data scientists 3. Introduction to algorithms by Cormen What was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. It starts with a test comprising of a few MCQs and coding questions before the actual interview, during October-December. Once you clear that, they will usually take 2-3 technical interviews. If you clear one round, you go on to the next. In these interviews, they will ask varied questions from your CV, some technical knowhow and again, more coding questions. The biggest focus is on whether you can find an optimal algorithm to solve the given problem/ implementation, and then code it in a reasonable amount of time. What are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? The coding questions are usually from DP or graph theory, and I didn't find a new question being asked. I was asked to implement an LRU cache thrice actually! And definitely brush up on your C++/Java skills - Base class / Super Class / OOP / Abstraction / Encapsulation etc. What are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector Take an active interest in competitive programming. Participate in competitions by codechef/hackerrank/topcodef/codeforces. One advice I would give is, even if you can't solve the problem during the contest, go back later and check out the editorial, and then solve it. If you still can't, see the author's / tester's solution and then solve it. By december, you should be able to solve all problems easier than \"Medium\".

Srinivasan Sivanandan - Placed at Samsung What was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. For most of the companies in Software Development sector, there was an online coding test to screen followed by 2-3 rounds of technical and HR interviews. The technical rounds were mostly based on algorithms, machine learning, programming languages, image processing, software development practices and puzzles. The HR round was based on my projects and internships along with the usual why this company? why select you? questions. What are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? I would recommend students interested in these profiles to have a strong working knowledge of algorithms in atleast one programming language. Machine learning, data science and IP skills with experience in these fields through internships and projects would be an added advantage to crack the interviews. Some HR questions like \"tell me about yourself\", \"strengths & weakness\" are so frequent that the interviewer expects an immediate answer from you. Preparing for those questions well before is advisable. What are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? To maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector, students must be well prepared in data structures, dynamic programming and graph theory. With a lot of companies interested in data sciences recently, machine learning and AI knowledge is highly recommended. Students can take up courses(on-campus or through MOOCs) and do internships to gain experience in these areas. Students can try to increase their CGPA if possible as it matters a lot in the selection processes. ResourcesMust do resources - geeksforgeeks, ambitionbox\nAdvanced resourses - Introduction to Algorithms - Cormen, Probability & Statistics - Hines, Machine Learning - Tom Mitchell\nAuxillary resourses - MOOCs (coursera, udacity, edX) General advice to students of all years: Good Internships and projects can get help you a lot in placements Have a goal and be unique in whatever you do in these 4/5 years - Companies look for unique profiles and personalities Sahil Grover - Placed at American Express Resume fitting for a data analysis profile are shortlisted. So writing R, Python and programming skills in the CV should help you getting shortlisted. Almost 200 students were shortlisted for the test. Make sure you mention your courses or projects related to data analysis in the resume. The test was on mettl.com\nIt was a very easy test which judges your quantitative aptitude and logical reasoning (find the next shape, find the missing number). Questions like \"find the least no to be multiplied by 100! such that is its divisible by 3^50?\" , \"find the probability of dice rolled three times to sum up as 10?\". Preparing for CAT would do. It is a very easy test. You need you ensure that all your questions are correct as there was a lot of time. I expected a very technical round with all sorts of questions on statistics and data analysis. But it was soft spoken interview. They literally want to know why you want to join data analysis and Why Amex? And how passionate are you towards work?\nInterview is taken by very experienced people from the company and is more of a discussion about ur cv and projects related to data analysis. They listen to whatever code or piece of programming you have done and how well you know.\nI talked about the courses I took to learn data analysis on coursera, my MTP project on optimization and its algorithms and why i wanted to join Amex.\nMy interview ended with a puzzle which was \"There is weight balance and i want to measure from 1 kg to 100 kg. So what is the minimum no of stones and their weights required to measure any material with weght between 1kg to 100 kg.\". I solved the problem and then he asked me why do you think this is the most optimum way. I answered it a bit and then he made my problem difficult by adding a information that \"we can put weights on both sides\". I was not able to solve it but defined the strategy should be used to find solution. My interview ended with my interviewer helping me solve the problem and explaining me the answers clearly. He said he will talk to HR but no HR round happened and I got selected. I would suggest to check with others about the kind of HR questions they ask. Be confident, talk about what you know. I started my data analysis in the last semester but was really amazed with the things I studied. So, most important thing is to find out if you like the domain or not. If the domain fits you, its the matter of showing interviewers the enthusiasm towards the subject genuinely. Placement is the matter of the interviewer understanding your motivation to work with the firm. So show them what you got for them.\nKnowing data analysis obviously helps but company expects you learn and grow rather learn in the company from most experienced people itself. Logical reasoning, Quantitative Aptitude, Statistical Inference, R programming Students with Shorlists/Offers across Multiple Sectors Vaibhav Goyal - Offers from Goldman Sachs, Shell; shorlists at Deutsche Bank, AB InBev What was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. I am writing this answer from a general point of view of finance companies (DB, CS, JPM). GS was more of a Quant based role. Mostly the first step is a resume based shortlisting followed by a GD (in case of DB, CS) or a written test (in case of JPM) followed by final interviews on DAY 1. For some profiles of CS, there is a quant test (the test is supposed to be tough but I am not really sure as I did not apply for those profiles). I only appeared for the process of DB so I am only going to (qualified to) talk about DB. Shortly after resume shortlisting, an interactive session is organised by DB. It’s a really good platform to understand the job role and get your queries answered from DB people itself. It is supposed to be a non-evaluative session but I’ll advise people to take it seriously. The GD is more of an interactive session, with a senior member of the management directing the conversation and asking for the views of everyone on a topic. On DAY 1, there will be multiple rounds of interviews for DB. My first round was a technical interview as I had a background in Finance (CFA L1 and IB Internship). For people who do not have a background in finance, first round will be a resume based interview). I was tested on various topics ranging from Corp Fin to FRA from CFA L1 but the majority of my interview was spent on my internship. Second and third rounds were both behavioural interviews with the senior management from DB. Be prepared for questions like Why Finance? Why DB? Why not (insert your major)? Why should we hire you? 3 shortcomings etc. As for GS, the first step is a written test (actually the first step is resume shortlisting but everyone is shortlisted) which comprises of three sections: Quant (Math), Machine Learning & Coding. One does not need to attempt all the sections to be selected for final interviews. I only attempted the Quant section which mainly comprised of questions from basic probability theory. Final interview was also on the same lines with puzzles and questions from basic probability theory. As the interview went on, the difficulty level of the questions kept on increasing but the domain was restricted to probability theory only. I would like to emphasise here that CODING is NOT REQUIRED for selection process of GS although obviously it is a big advantage. I have never written a line of code (except for the 1styear PDS course) in my entire life. They are just evaluating your line of thinking and whether you will be able to learn on the job or not. 2.    Online tests (Part1-20min; Part2-45 min) 3.    E-Tray exercise before the day of interview: In this exercise you will be given a role in the company and documents of certain project. Then you will be receiving a series of mails from different people in the organization or people related to the project. You have to choose the most suitable answer from 5 given options based on the information provided and assuming the role given to you.) Part 1: Solving a case-30 min for preparation, 45 min discussion on case; Part 2: Series of competency based, situational and behavioural questions to be assessed against the CAR criteria) The selection procedure of AB Inbev is a pretty long drawn out process. Starts with online application followed by 2 online tests. One of them is a logical reasoning test while the other one is a behavioural test. Further shortlisting is based on your test results as well as your resume. After this you will have the individual business case round. It's essentially a case study where you have to recommend 2 seasonal beers for the launch based on the given data. You will be asked follow up questions based on your recommendations. I also had a standard HR interview along with the Business Case round. If you clear this, then you'll be invited for the business game round. You'll be divided into teams (with fellow applicants) and will be given certain roles in a company like VP Sales, VP Finance, President etc.. There would be certain objectives listed for the company and together you have to achieve those. It's a really fun game and you'll surely enjoy it. If you clear that, then they will fly you to Shanghai for the final round. The final round is a panel interview with the most senior management of AB Inbev like APAC President, Head Supply, Head HR etc. What are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? I would advise people to prepare for resume based and HR Questions for companies like DB, Shell, AB Inbev and puzzles for GS. Technical questions mostly depend on the profile of the individual but as a general rule people should be thorough with their resumes and should be able to talk freely about their internships/projects. Questions like Walk me through your resume, Tell me about yourself are a given and should be answered without any problems. HR prep is one of the most underrated parts of placement preparation. You are bound to face HR Questions at some point or the other in the interview whether you are sitting for a technical role like ITC or a management role like Shell or AB-Inbev. But most of the people tend to leave HR prep for too late and hence suffer during the placements. Please do not make the same mistakes. What are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector? 1. GS – If you are really sure about going to GS then start reading about probability theory, expectation theory (If you want to go through the Quant route) and try learning coding (It would be a big advantage going into the placement season). But it is not something that can’t be done from July to December. 4. Finance: Get a good internship in the sector. Most of the people who were shortlisted either had great POR’s or had good internships in this sector. Since you can’t do a lot about the former, try to work on the latter. I believe that one of the major points that differentiated my resume from the rest of the people was my internship. Try to get an internship where you get to work on a live deal (like an IPO or M&A deal). It is a real great talking point in the interviews and would set you apart from the rest. Also, if you are sure about finance as a long term career choice, try to read about certifications like CFA, FRM etc. and see if they will help you further in your career. Do not give CFA blindly just for sake of getting shortlisted. These certifications will definitely help in shortlisting but you will have to defend them in a rigorous interview. 1.

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Most of the Aerospace companies had the following rounds: - CV shortlisting (sometimes they would shortlist all), -  Technical/Quantitative/Mental Ability/Verbal test round : sometimes (like in case of Airbus) the test was specific to the job profile we applied to and involved purely technical questions of the field. - Interview (technical): generally half an hour to 1 hour long. Some companies ask questions from CV and other past experiences while some others focus on conceptual questions from core Aerospace. - Interview (HR): They ask questions on acads and extra acads in CV and maybe things you know about their company. They try to analyze your commitment and other attributes they are looking for in your answers. Keeping cool and confident with everything in your CV is the key. What are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? - At the start of any interview(technical or HR): \"Tell me about yourself\". Keep it short and personal. Don't go with the scripted form of answering this question. This question can give a good first impression. - \"Where do you see yourself in 5/10 years?\" - If you have a high CGPA, prepare to answer the question- \"What is the guarantee that you won't leave the job and go for higher studies?\" ... Do not go with a cliched answer. Prepare your own and keep it natural and ensure it doesn't sound like a rehearsed one. What are things students can do from now till December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector. - For Core companies, go through the basic concepts, possible questions and problems/puzzles of your courses of the last few years. Some ask from fundamentals while some interviewers ask from advanced level courses from 3rd or 4th years of study. So prepare both types well. While preparing, its best to do so with at least one friend. Make an approximate schedule/timetable with a friend and decide the subjects from your 1st-4th/5th years and other relevant topics that you want to read for the interviews. I just went through the posts in ambitionbox and other such websites for each company. Tried to look up commonly asked question types. It particularly helped in preparing for the tests, which are usually the first round. What was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Companies in the civil sector usually follow a 3 rounds process, starting with the Resume short listing, Group Discussion and then the final Personal Interview Round. Civil Sector comprises are of two types, construction companies and the engineering consultants. Construction companies are usually looking up for management skills along with the technical skills as compared to the engineering consultants which are more of focused on the technical knowledge. Therefore the selection process of construction firms will also require a good communication skills along with sound technical knowledge. The selection process of Shapoorji Pallonji Group comprised of 3 rounds. In the first round consisted of a technical(MCQ) test and a verbal ability[MCQ] test. Further the shortlisted students had a Group Discussion round, followed by the last round of Personal Interview where questions related to HR and Technical were asked. What are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? HR questions like, Tell me about yourself? or Introduce yourself? or Walk me through your resume? are very common and mostly the opening questions. If you have thought of entering into this sector you should always be prepared for the questions like, Why Civil? Why construction? Why not some non-core firms? Will you be able to work on field if required? and if you are from particular specialization like Structural Engg. then be prepared to face, Why not design? Why only construction? What are things students can do from now till December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector? First of all it is very important to make up your mind whether you want to go into this sector or not, riding with legs on different boat never helps. So look up good for the pros and cons and then only continue with your preparations. For preparations for technical rounds, I suggest you just need to start brushing up the material of your courses till the 6th semester, prepare a notebook to write up the key formulas and tips that you will need to give a quick look before your interviews. For the preparations for HR rounds, I suggest keep practicing group discussions with your friends, try to write answers to the commonly asked HR questions and prepare up your resume well. Ocean Engineering and Naval Architecture What was the general interview process for most companies of this sector? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process. Short PPT--> A 45 mins test ---> immediate results (in about 20 mins) arranged performance wise (13 people shortlisted) -->Detailed PPT ---> Interview (called in the same order of results), only1 roundof interview covering both technical and HR rounds What are some of the FAQs that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? About the test- Not a difficult test to crack if your basics are sound. It consisted of 20 short MCQs (easy) covering metacentric height calculations, trim, MCT etc. Mainly covering hydrostatics (most imp), sea keeping & maneuvering, structural terms etc. It had two 5 marks questions - to draw a standard mid ship section, and identify some structural terms like deck girder, beam, bilge keel, floor etc. and the other was to identify ship types for some given ships (Titanic, INS virat etc). Finally 2 hydrostatics numericals, 10 marks each were asked. Test Preparation Tips- Hydrostatics is the most important thing to be studied. I referred to \"Introduction to Naval Architecture by Eric Tupper\" for quick revision.The numericals asked, were very similar to solved examples. I had my 2nd Year's internship over there. That helped a lot. You should have a little idea of ships built over there, mainly the ship types. Stay attentive during the intro/ ppt, they talk about it. Don't hurry during the test, there's ample amount of time. Interview Tips-  Be very thorough with your internships and project. Two of my internships were core, the other was a steel plant training. All technical questions asked were related to the core internships. They may re-frame some situations(from internship) or may go into more depths of the topic covered in internships/ projects. You might not get to the final solution directly. They mainly check your approach, they also help you and give appropriate hints if your approach is right. Explain them what you are thinking, properly. In some cases (not for me) they also asked areas of interest, choose a topic you are very confident with. For HR round you need to show them how interested you are really in joining the company and why you are a good fit for them. They also ensure that you don't run away too soon. So make sure you don't give that impression. Be confident, and explain yourself properly, give instances from your CV if possible to support your answers. For eg, I was asked at the end, are you ready to learn new things / do u mind learning completely new stuff.., to which i quoted from my internship where i learnt something new and completed my job and about my BTP where i was learning something new. Extra acads (mine were decent) was a field they did not touch directly but I bought that up in the conversation to support something and they had to notice.

This wiki is an effort to compile the best-practices and resources that helped students get job offers, in various sectors. Each section contains interview processes, FAQs, placement semester preparation guides and a list of essential resources. The companies that visit campus to recruit students can be broadly categorized under the following sectors - consulting, investment banking/ finance, software development, data analytics, FMCG, and core engineering. The interview process involves multiple levels of interviews. The initial rounds may be over telephone, Skype or in person subject to the company's preference. There maybe a total of 3-5 rounds of interviews. The interviews may be of the following types : Case Interviews : They are the most important/difficult interviews for a consulting job. The question may or may not involve numbers. Be sure to ask as many questions as you can, and be at your presentable best. Guesstimates/ Data Interpretation : The structure and methodology is far more important in these questions, than to get the numbers right. HR Interviews : This involves usual HR questions with a special preference to how presentable the candidate is, to potential clients and also on what the candidate is really interested in, as consulting companies face attrition problems all the time. \"Tell me something about yourself, walk me through your resume.\" \"What's the most challenging environment/work you've faced?\" \"Why consulting? Why the firm? Why you?\" \"Where do you see yourself 5/10 years later?\" \"What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses?\" \"Mention one of your failures.\" \"Questions on being a team player, leader, displaying ownership, creativity and initiatives\" Placement Semester Survival Guide Form a case group, and practice as many cases as you can. Your interviews must ideally be your interview number 50 or above. Consulting companies love high points in your CV, be it in academics, extra-academics, sports, competitions, etc. So, highlight them, or further extend the list if possible.

This test has short programming questions and at times knowledge questions on programming languages. Most common questions on programming languages are on C,C++ or Java.  After you qualify the coding test, you get shortlisted for the interview, usually for all the SDE positions. The general process consists of 2-3 technical rounds followed by 1 HR round. Some companies (Usually Microsoft) has a Group Discussion Round too to shortlist where they give a design question of a system where everyone is asked to collaborate and discuss on how to design the specified system as Company employees judge on how much a candidate contributes. In the technical rounds, they ask 2-3 coding questions which you have to code on paper(proper syntax and everything, not pseudo code) and/or domain related questions from DBMS, Networks, OS and ML(if mentioned in the resume). The biggest focus is on whether you can find an optimal algorithm to solve the given problem/ implementation, and then code it in a reasonable amount of time. The coding questions are usually from DP or graph theory. Definitely brush up on your C++/Java skills - Base class / Super Class / OOP / Abstraction / Encapsulation Preparing for the typical HR questions is a must. Other than that you should have \"introduce yourself\" prepared and oriented to the company position that you are applying to. Explain one of the projects that you have worked on, in detail. Be sure to go through your resume very well and have something prepared for every project/ achievement that you have written on your resume. Placement Semester Survival Guide Code. Code. Code.

        "content": "Roboticsat IIT Kharagpur is worked on, promoted, and propagated by the activities of several technical societies and student run research groups. TheCentre for Excellence in Roboticsis the umbrella organisation of all robotics related activities, and is currently funding 12 research projects throughSRIC. These projects are in multiple departments involving fields varying from humanoid, aerial vehicles, social assistants, underwater vehicles and more. In addition to doing research, many of the groups participate in national and international robotics competitions, providing the involved students an opportunity to learn more about the advancements pushing forward the field of robotics. The competitions includeIGVC,FIRA,IARC,Robocup,  andRoboSub. Robotics is also a popular field for theInter-Hall hardware exhibitionwhere many halls develop products on robotics and automation, including a wall climbing human skeleton, a bomb diffusing robot, a gesture-controlled arm, a humanoid robot, all-terrain vehicles and transforming robots.[1] Robotics at IIT Kharagpur has a long history which, until recently, revolved around initiatives by students. It started in the form of a small student run society calledTechnology Robotix Society, with the aim of spreading the culture of robotics in Kharagpur and India, in the year 2001. The society formed a group called theKharagpur Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Group(KRAIG), which was a group of students who would teach hobby robotics to students in IIT Kharagpur. Over time, they started doing workshops across India in colleges like NIT Durgapur, JIIT, BIT Mesra and many more. As they popularised robotics in India, in order to keep the wheel running, they came up with Robotix, the annual robotics competition. The fest became a hub of hobby robotics and a huge platform for people across the country involved in hobby robotics to meet and showcase their skills.[2][3] Soon, robotics started becoming more popular and students started shifting from hobby robotics to robotics research. They started participating and performing in competitions likeDRDO Ground Vehicleand IIT Kharagpur hosted Robocup@India in 2009[4]with the help ofProf. Pedro Lima, former trustee of Robocup foundation andAamir Ahmad. This brought the attention of professors on campus initiating two of the oldest robotics projects at IIT Kharagpur –AGVandKRSSG.[3] As more students started to show interest in robotics, professorsC.S.KumarandD. K. Pratiharfrom the Department of Mechanical Engineering started offering projects in robotics.[5]Two courses were also started on robotics in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. With the advent of robotics in IIT Kharagpur, a proposal for a Centre for Excellence in Robotics was drafted with the initiative of Prof.Partha Pratim Chakrabarti, with the help of multiple professors and Nalin Gupta, a final year student and then Student Coordinator ofAGVin August 2014.[1]This included 10 robotics project proposals from multiple departments, students and professors.[3] In December 2014, the proposal was accepted, and included 12 projects and a total fund of ₹ 5 crore approved through the Institute and Centre for Excellence in Robotics[5]was kick-started withProf. D. K. Pratiharas its \"Overall Coordinator\".[5][3]Currently, all 12 projects are running independently funded through Sponsored Research and Industrial Consultancy (SRIC).[3] Currently, IIT Kharagpur officially offers only three courses related to robotics, all in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.[5] However, many courses related to robotics are taught in different departments, such as Image Processing, Embedded Systems, Control Systems.

For example, third year B.Tech (Hons.) students will have the option to switch over from 4 year B.Tech (Hons.) course to a 5 year Dual Degree course in the same department, including a choice of the specialization.[1] Switch over to Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Students admitted to the 4-year B. Tech (Hons.) / 5-year Dual Degree Program throughJEE (Advanced)are eligible for switch over to the Dual Degree programs ofEngineering Entrepreneurship/Financial Engineering. The constraints for such arrangement is that the interested student must have completed all the prescribed course work for the first two semesters in first attempt with a minimumCGPAof 6.00. The notification is brought during the spring semester of academic year, and accordingly, an eligible student must make his application through i) online application and ii) submission of signed hard copy toacademic sectionby the specified deadline. An important point to that note that application for branch change is also made during the same time, and both of these processes are independent of each other. In case an application is approved for the both, change of branch allotted to a student would prevail over the option of Interdisciplinary Dual Degree Program. Third year B.Tech (Hons.) students have an option to switch over to an existing 5-year Dual Degree course (one-way and not the reverse) in the same department, including a choice of specialization, offered at 2-year M.Tech. level in the Department maintaining proportionate distribution of seats. The student must have completed all the curricular requirements up to sixth semester and must not have any backlog subjects with a minimum CGPA of 6.00.

Some topics are new whereas topics such as Internal Energy, Entropy and Laws of thermodynamics are taught from a new perspective which helps to understand the topic that come after end sem. Various kinds of engines used in Aerospace Industry are taught which is called Parametric Analysis. Topics covered before mid sem will be helpful here. Ramjet,Turbofan, Turbojet and Propeller based engines are the ones whose parametric study is done.On surface its just bunch of equations but beneath those equations its mostly conceptual design of ideal engines. 2. Go through the previous year paper. 3. Read the books (only the part which is taught in the class) because often times prof won't tell certain things clearly Most of the Material will be shared by the Prof. Otherwise till mid sem its Thermodynamics by PK Nag. And after End Sem Jack Mattingly Elements of Propulsion. And there is nptel lecture series of Jet Aircraft Propulsion by Bhaskar Roy of IIT Bombay good for the AE31008 as well and end sem of this course https://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/ take it as your handbook of formulas for AE31008 and AE31001"

Well researched reports with original thoughts would help in scoring. For full marks, be prepared to read research papers and quote from them. Feedback is given and is quite helpful. To score well in the design project, work from day 1 consistently and keep communicating with the professor and the TAs. Try to finish the manufacturing and experiments early, as these often lead to delays. Choose a good team, where people are willing to work. This is extremely important. Before choosing a topic, talk to the seniors who have worked on it before, else you might end up repeating their work."

        "content": "A project maintainer is a volunteer developer who has complete development control and admin access to the repository of one particularproject. Each project may have multiple maintainers and they may change over time. They are separate from the metaKGP communityadmins. Responsibilities of a Maintainer While a project maintainer is reponsible for the development of a project, they are not expected to regularly work on it and it is a purely voluntary position. A maintainer may step down and/or nominate someone else to take the responsibility if they feel that they will not be able to devote time. Apart from directing the development of the project, the following are the primary duties of a maintainer: Reviewing and merging pull requests Managing issues and tracking progress Ensure the deployment runs successfully and resolve any crashes The maintainer is not responsible for deploying the project on the server, but a CD pipeline will be set up by theSysAdminand future deployments will happen automatically. If any error occurs on the server, the SysAdmin can provide error logs to the maintainer. Permissions Granted to the Maintainer A project maintainer is added as anoutside collaboratorto the Github repository of the project. They do not get access to other repositories, access to thehosting server, ormembershipin the Github organization, but get full administrative privileges over the project's repository. When a maintainer is added as an outside collaborator, they are given the \"Maintain\"repository role, which gives the user all privileges except destructive actions such as deletion.Thisarticle lists all the permissions granted to the collaborator, which includes the following: Manage pull requests and issues A maintainer can be added to a project by one of the following ways: An existing project maintainer can nominate a new maintainer for the project. If a project independently started is adopted into metaKGP, the original developer(s) is/are made the maintainer(s). If the current maintainer of a project graduates or becomes inactive for a while, anadmincan decide to make an active contributor the maintainer. As a directive policy, current maintainers must strive to ensure that there is atleast one non-final-year maintainer each for the project(s) they are maintaining. Only admins of the Github organization can add new maintainers to a repository. The following steps need to be followed for adding a new maintainer: Invite the maintainer as an \"external collaborator\" if they are not a member of the metaKGP Github organization. Add the name of the maintainer under the \"Maintainer(s)\" section of the README. If the previous maintainer is no longer active, add their name to the \"Past Maintainer(s)\" section of the README. Create the section if it doesn't exist yet. If the maintainer satisfies the criteria tojoin the organization, send them an invite to the Github organization."

        "content": "IQPS (Intelligent Question Paper Search)is a tool for searching and uploading previous year question papers. It was inspired by and is the successor ofMFQP. Question papers for End Semester Exams, Mid Semester Exams, Class Tests and Supplementary Exams can be uploaded by users to the website. The following steps are to be followed: Go tohttps://qp.metakgp.org/upload Upload your question paper PDFs (at most 10). For each paper uploaded, IQPS will try to guess the details of the paper (Course Code, Semester, Exam Type, etc.). Click on the Edit (pencil) icon next to each paper, and check all the details, filling any missing data. Once you ensure that all details are correct, click on \"Upload\". This adds the papers to IQPS. Once admins approve your paper, others can find them on IQPS and benefit from them! Year Guidelines:The \"Year\" field is to be set to the year in which the exam was held. For example: An autumn semester exam for the session 2024-25 should have the year set to 2024, whereas a spring semester exam for the same session will have year 2025. An IQPS admin is someone who has access to the admin dashboard, which can be used to approve, edit or delete papers. The project maintainer must be an admin. A new admin (who is not a member of the GitHub organisation) can be added by updating theGH_ADMIN_USERNAMESenvironment variable, which is a comma separated list of usernames of GitHub accounts of the admins. Amember of the GitHub organisationcan be made an admin by inviting them to the \"IQPS Admins\" team on GitHub. Papers uploaded by users move to an review stage, where admins need to approve the paper before it is searchable publicly. To approve papers: Go to the admin dashboard:https://qp.metakgp.org/admin(Only accessible to admins) List of unapproved papers are shown. To approve a paper, click on the Edit (pencil) icon next to the paper. A edit view for the paper opens.On the left, there is a preview of the paper PDF. It can be expanded to take up the full screen by clicking on the Expand icon.In the center, there are options to edit details of the paper, and its approval status (Approved/Unapproved).On the right, there is a listing of \"Similar Papers\". A paper is similar to another paper if they share the same course code, year, semester and exam type. In the listing, similar papers which are approved are highlighted green. On the left, there is a preview of the paper PDF. It can be expanded to take up the full screen by clicking on the Expand icon. In the center, there are options to edit details of the paper, and its approval status (Approved/Unapproved). On the right, there is a listing of \"Similar Papers\". A paper is similar to another paper if they share the same course code, year, semester and exam type. In the listing, similar papers which are approved are highlighted green. Ensure all the details of the paper are correctly filled. Choose \"Approved\" for the approve status, and click on \"Update Details\" to approve the paper. In the edit options, a 'note' field exists which can be used to indicate additional information about the paper. Papers for Supplementary exams should have the note field set to \"Supplementary\". Other uses of the field include mentioning tests having conducted in multiple slots, or different papers conducted for different groups (e.g. different papers for first year and second year). When approving a newly uploaded paper, the listing of similar papers shows other existing PDFs that are potentially for the same question paper. This is helpful in preventing accidentally having two PDFs for the same question paper. IQPS finds similar papers by looking for papers with the same Course Code, Year, Semester and Exam Type as the paper being edited. Similar papers which are approved will be highlighted in green, while unapproved papers will not be highlighted. Before looking at the similar papers, ensure that the paper being approved has all the correct metadata, otherwise the similar papers listed may be irrelevant. Note that the papers shown under the listing aren't guaranteed to be the same paper as the one being edited, due to many reasons. Two papers being similar can mean any of the following: (In what follows, 'original paper' refers to the paper being edited / approved, and 'similar paper' refers to one of the papers listed under the listing) The original paper and similar paper are for the same question paper. The original paper is mislabelled (wrong metadata) The similar paper is mislabelled (wrong metadata) The original paper and the similar paper differ in the \"Note\" field (e.g. the similar paper is for a main exam whereas the original paper is for a supplementary exam, or vice versa). In this case no admin decision is required since everything is correctly labelled and no duplicate paper exists. Thus, it is recommended to compare the contents of the PDFs of the original and similar paper(s) to identify the reason. In case the similar paper is for the same question paper (Case 1), the admin has to choose which version to keep. Here are some general guidelines to determine which version to choose in case multiple PDFs exist. All questions and relevant information must be legible. The scan of the PDF must be of good quality. Generally, scanned PDFs from thelibrary question paper archiveare of higher quality (and thus preferred) than those uploaded by users, but this is not always the case. A PDF containing both questions and answers/solutions for the paper is preferred over one having only questions (since it is more helpful for the user). An original typeset PDF of the question paper is preferred over a scanned PDF of the paper. In other cases where some paper is mislabelled, the admin must fix the metadata for that paper. Each similar paper listed on the right has a checkbox next to them which can be used to replace papers with the one being approved. While approving a paper, check the boxes for all those papers which needs to be replaced. Then, approve the paper (click on \"Update Details\"). This will approve the paper, and delete the papers which were selected for replacement. The main web-app has a Rust backend and a React frontend. It uses a PostgreSQL database as its primary data store. The backend and the database is hosted on theserver. The frontend is hosted on Vercel. Another service, called the 'crawler' is a Go script which crawls and downloads papers from thelibrary question papers archivefor a given year and semester, and spits out an archive with the PDFs and the metadata. Correspondingly, there is a Rust script 'import-papers', which can import the papers from the archive into the database."

This semester we are trying to crowdsource collecting question papers, as the library database of question papers is missing many papers. This is mostly because there is no centralised process for collecting question papers and uploading them. We are also talking to the professors in charge of conducting exams, to figure out if it is possible to obtain question papers directly, but decided not to wait, as it seems easier to just do it ourselves. If we get a large number of uploads, this expanded database should be quite useful for students. When people send us question papers to email id[email protected], we verify that it's legible and correct, convert it to PDF, and host it online. For the question papers available on the library, we crawl the library website to get a list of urls. We build a database of urls to question papers, and tag them with year, subject code, semester, subject name. Most of this process is automated. When a user visits the MFQP search page, they download the entire index of question papers (a few kb gzipped). We use a fast string matching library along with a custom ranking formula to provide instant results. Source code:https://github.com/metakgp/mfqp/andhttps://github.com/mfqp-source/"

Announce the election, make a public post about it and then try to remain on the schedule. Personally talk to every person who you think should contest. Find out their reason why they think they should or should not contest and clarify any doubts which might have. Especially talk to new people, they might be shy to take the initiative to contest by themselves, and you asking them personally might convince them they are actually welcomed to contest and lead the community. Prepare the voters list and announce it the community Conduct the mock polls. This step is necessary if you are conducting the polls on a platform which hasn't been used in metakgp election before. Even if you have used the platform before, you don't want any technical surprises during the actual election. Ask candidates to send in their SOPs to you and offer them private comments, also encourage candidates to seek feedback from other community member. Make sure you follow up with the candidates so that they turn in their SOPs timely. After the nomination date is over, publish all the SOPs on the wiki, offer public comments on them and encourage discussion. Conduct an in person session where people can meet the candidates and discuss their SOPs. The date of final poll is here, make a post about it.

As of now the metakgp team follows a Laissez-faire system of organization,\nwhere each one does what they think is best for is best for them and the team. One of the main reason to not to have a formal structure has been cited as the\nneed to remove an appeal to authority. We as team don't want someone to do\nsomething just because a authority figure has asked them do to do so. We also don't want a system where a senior student has a more decision making\npower in the team just because of the number of years spend by them in KGP.

The take away from this meeting was that we should be as precise as we can regarding the data we want. Like instead of asking for course content, syllabus and all we should be asking for: List of all course codes and their names Grade distribution of all courses Pre-requisites for all courses. Then we should ask the Academic section again for the question papers.

We'll create a voters list from the list of wiki contributors and email everyone about the elections The election portal will be a simple web app, where people will enter a unique key privately given to people by the election coordinator and select their candidate. The web-app,will nottrack who voted for whom and will simply give the aggregate result after the alloted period. We plan to sit this together this Sunday for a editathon. Few things to do during the editathon are: New Programmers Guide -- A guide to orient new programmers Create a Screen cast + Video describing what Metakgp is and how to edit existing pages and how to create new pages. Mark pages which needs work, which are incomplete and which are outdated We plan to make a post about MFQP on Saturday evening, starting a week long drive to collect the question paper. Everyday we'll release stats about how many papers we collected on that particular day and how contributed the most number of papers. We also need to talk to the examination in-charge of our respective department asking for previous question papers. We should make regular posts highlighting the good articles + acknowledging the work of the editors. We need to ask our friends to write the following guides: The server is being transferred to Vivek's account. It was decided that to maintain the server we all should contribute some amount of money. It was decided that we should move the DNS from Vikrant Varma to Ayush Goyal or a common account the credentials to which are held by multiple people. This will let the switching of DNS records happen without friction."

Discuss the state of the Dashboard and its individual components (especially Cab Centrale and Cab booking portal). Discuss dates and moonshots for the upcoming HackDay Pitch new projects to be taken up this semester Discuss administrative issues including the need for a professor mentor, funding and a permanent room for MetaKGP. Create a list of potential contestants A list of current active members was created whom the current Election Coordinator (EC) Arun Patro will be contacting. A sophomore's views on the current drawbacks / issues with MetaKGP There is not enough motivation to contribute to the Wiki. Initial contributors get worn out soon. There are not enough contributors to the Wiki. The Wiki should contain 'funda' from graduating seniors to preserve their learnings from their 4 years in the campus that can be beneficial to the newer batches. The Wiki doesn't always have original content and has a lot of material copied over directly from other sites. A huge number of courses (majorly electives/breadth subjects) are not yet listed on the Wiki. The current system in place to collect question papers feels complicated and acts as a major barrier to new contributors. Moreover, there are no 'instructions' on the current site describing how to add new question papers.\nHemant Kumar will be working to fix this. He has proposed to solve it using a simpler upload portal, which he will be discussing on our Slack channels before starting work. A major suggestion from Arun Patro and Ayush Goyal was that the Wiki should have a review system in place for all courses. A long discussion ensued on the same, and the following was decided: A course review system should be in place where students can leave their reviews and ratings for each course. To start with, Arun Patro will be creating a google form through which volunteers from the group can each fill reviews for at least 5 courses from their department. This reviews will eventually be channelled back to the Wiki manually. This could prove as a starting point for future contributors to leave reviews. Ayush Goyal will be working on a portal through which students can upload notes for a course (which will be uploaded to archive.org). These notes will be linked on the course page. A future addition to this could be a way to leave a rating on these notes so as to sort them by rating later on. A dashboard was created by 4 members from MetaKGP during Inter-IIT Tech Meet at IIT Kanpur. This dashboard is to be released to the general public (i.e. KGPians) sometime this year. Some of the individual components of the dashboard were discussed in further detail: Naresh Ramesh will be working with Siddharth Kannan to encrypt the user's ERP credentials (used for components like MFQP) on the dashboard before sending it through the network. Aimed at replacing the current Facebook group by the same moniker used by KGPians, KGP Cab Centrale should ease the process of finding partners for Cab pooling. This component of the dashboard was implemented completely during the Tech Meet and will be made public by the end of the week to the KGP public. Key functionalities included creating postings and searching using from/to location, time, time flexibility and the number of available seats as parameters. A cab booking portal was also created during the Tech Meet, that worked on the principle of giving the Cab Drivers in KGP an app to indicate their current availability. A page would be available on the dashboard that shows the list of registered drivers and their mobile numbers, alongside their current status. This idea will now be pivoted to indicate the live status of restaurants instead, which is more feasible. This idea is currently in low-priority and will be worked upon next semester. To be worked on by Ayush Goyal, Rameshwar Bhaskaran, Athitya Kumar and Naresh Ramesh The first Hackday for the year will be held in the 3rd / 4th week of August (To-be announced). Some of the moonshot ideas for the HackDay that were suggested during the meeting were: Use MetaKGP's Wiki data to train a Word2Vec for KGP \"Google Maps for KGP\" that can be created using the Google Maps API and links Wiki articles to locations on the map The idea is to create a caching system within KGP that aims to bring down the total bandwidth usage within campus by using cached data when available for YouTube videos. Nishant Nikhil and Naresh Ramesh have started work on this, and will soon make the work public. Migrate 'Listen To This KGP' under MetaKGP Listen To This KGP is a popular Facebook group where KGPians share their favourite music through YouTube links. Naresh Ramesh is working on a standalone site that will exist alongside the Facebook group that fetches the content posted on the group and creates playlists and smart filters through filters like user, artist, genre, etc. There was a discussion on whether the current system of having elections every 4 months was too frequent, and should be done every 6 months instead. The discussion ended with choosing to continue with the current system. Getting a professor as a mentor for MetaKGP was considered and will be discussed further on the Slack channel. The initial response to the idea was positive for the decision. Transition into a Gymkhana society The pros and cons of moving to a Gymkhana society were discussed. The issue stemmed from the issue of insufficient funds for MetaKGP right now, and the realisation that depending on funding from seniors will not work out in the long term. Discussion to be continued on the Slack channels. The need for a permanent room for MetaKGP This is possible only if the previous point is satisfied. The motive would be to increase overall developer productivity when working together on projects. Not high priority. Redirect metakgp.org to metakgp.github.io, which will be improved upon by Kaustubh Hiware to better describe MetaKGP and its projects Arun Patro to circulate the Google form for course reviews Naresh Ramesh to deploy the dashboard as is, and to release Cab Centrale."

The initiative was taken up by Ksheera Sagar the UG Representative to the Senate. He got to know about the MetaKGP hack day, and he thought of a bigger version of it to bring all the developers in the campus on a single platform and also welcome students who are interested in becoming developers. Following were the goals he thought of : 1. To give a brief idea of works done by MetaKGP and the open source community on campus 2. Ongoing key projects and initiatives 3. Discussing the potential projects for the upcoming and existing developers 4. Explaining the necessity of ERP API 5. Presentation of 2–3 student wellness projects by myself and Krushi (G.Sec Students Welfare TSG) which needs developers 6. Encouraging women from STEM areas to start with dev 7. Requesting the professors (like PPD, PDG, PPC….) to speak on this occasion 8. Requesting office/ lab space for developers Metakgp,Lean In,Kharagpur Open Source Society,Institute Wellness Groupcame together to make the event a success. The event started with Naresh and Nishant giving an introduction of MetaKGP and its various projects. After that Kshitij gave a presentation about the initiatives of KOSS to promote the opensource culture in the campus. \nSiddharth took the opportunity to bring to the notice of the administration on how providing some open endpoints to the data in ERP can help developer community build cool projects around the ERP and benefits of enabling an OAuth 2.0 authentication for the ERP to make it more developer friendly. One of the most frustrating and time-consuming thing for all the final and pre-final year students in building their CV on ERP. Ksheera Sagar pointed out the problems in the CV module and proposed a solution for the same. \nWe all know how bad the gender ratio is in IITs and it is worst in the tech community of the IITs, Ayushi Mrigen gave an introduction about Lean In and also an insight of the perspective of girls community on why they think this problem exists and what are their steps to improve this situation. Prof Sriman Kumar Bhattacharyya, Prof Pallab Dasgupta, Prof Adrijit Goswami shared their views on the open source movement currently prevailing in the campus and about the steps already taken by the administration and their plans of the future to help the developer community. Prof Sriman Kumar Bhattacharyya, Deputy Director, IIT Kharagpur briefed the students about the opportunities for the funding of projects and lab spaces from the administration side. Professor PDG of Computer Science and Technology Department, an alumnus of the batch of ’90, shared the story from his college time. Since we all know, it was the time of genesis of open source. He shared how they were just shifting to UNIX systems and how Donald Knuth developed Tex and open sourced it, but due to complications, no one was able to use it and later came Latex a more user-friendly version of Tex which was again open sourced. His talk was very insightful and inspired a lot of people sitting there. Prof Adrijit Goswami, ERP Chairman, talked about how the ERP functioning is different in Kharagpur than other IITs and the autonomous structure of ERP in our institute. He also told about the current problems faced in ERP and how students can help in overcoming them. Though, he didn’t talk much related to the presentation given by Siddharth on OAuth for ERP which was quite disheartening.

        "content": "After a year of running Metakgp we came to consensus that we need to add some structure to Metakgp to keep it going (seeTyranny of Structurelessness). The structure we came up with is that there will be three maintainers of Metakgp, who will coordinate the community and projects and take administrative decisions if required. The initial three maintainers have a term of one year, eight months, and four months. After the first election the term for each maintainer is one year, with term of one maintainer expiring every four month and hence election being conducted every four month to fill that post. This ensures that the whole team of maintainers don't changed in one election. The first elections were supposed to be conducted in May 2016 but only two candidates came up Vivek Rai and Harsh Gupta and the role of a maintainer was never formally given to anyone. The election which was supposed to happen in October 2016 never happened. InMarch 2017 electionthe community elected its first three maintainers,Naresh R,Nishant NikhilandAyush Goyalhaving a term for whole year, 8 months and 4 months respectively.

Any person who is a student of IIT KGP for their entire term as maintainer is eligible. This includes first years, PG students or people who have not contributed to the wiki. The nominees need to send their names, introduction and statement of purpose to the election coordinator before the deadline. Guideline for the Statement of Purpose (SOP) One of the SOP format you can use is: About me (Give introduction, what year, what department, briefly what have you done at Metakgp and outside, description of any leadership role you might have taken (not a requirement)).

        "content": "Metakgp:Old Governance Model/Election March 2017/SOP Arun Patro I am Arun Patro, a dual degree student in Electrical Engineering, currently in my fourth year. My handles are @arun (slack) and@arunpatro(github). Created grade distribution charts to course pages (blackjack). I was a Team Leader at AIESEC's GEP portfolio that saw me mentoring the 4 members to facilitate international exchanges during summers. (6 months) I was the governor ofEncorefor AY 2015-16. During the tenure, I along with my co-governors were responsible for putting up 3 stage plays, 1 street play and take a team of 10 for an outstation. It was during this tenure that Encore recieved a Bronze during Rangmanch, the stage play competetion, inSpring Fest. Along with handling the outstation, the finances and the practices, I was responsible for training 30 UG and 5 PG freshers and teaching them the many facets of theatre and dramatics. My governership saw the resumption of taking in PG freshers after nearly 4 years. I was briefly a part ofAGVin my first year, where I got most of my practical electronic knowledge and experience. I learnt Image Processing and Computer Vision here, which I have later continued in my BTP and other personal projects. I was a mentor for the winter workshop in Dec  '14 for IP. My first internship was atCyientwhere I worked on an configurable IoT enabler. This included learning in the fields of computer networking, the BLE protocol and nodejs. My second internship was atGE Healthcarein the X-Ray Engineering division. I worked on creating a dashboard (Software), Capacitor characterization (Power Electronics) and Remote Beacons (IoT). Metakgp is a repository and platform all about KGP and its people. It serves the purpose of facilitating the collection, documention, archival and dissemination of all trivial and non-trivial information about KGP and its ethos. The prime purpose of metakgp’s existence is information and collaboration. This is what metakgp and its members will help in facilitating. We will only create tools, sites, platforms, collect information from administration and ERP. Metakgp will provide API to all the information. Projects like grade distribution analysis, CGPA analysis, chatbots, etc i.e. non generic tools not to be maintained by metakgp but individual developers. They can however be affliated to metakgp. Competition here is harmful for us and not that right way forward. To compete means to make something that’s already out there (in a better way), which is not the point of our existence. I want to approach the growth and future of metakgp without any competition and in a synergic and symbiotic manner. Further down the line, I want metakgp to be the backbone of every other society out there. This can work by us increasing their (any society’s) productivity, reach, building a website, etc for them. They must just help us collect, document, archive and disseminate information about KGP. All plans that I propose are inline with my philosophy of creating novel, collaborative and generic tools and platforms that targets all of KGP. Synergy with other societies is of prime importance for harmonious co-existence. The core of all these projects is to have a more rigid deadline based projects headed by project maintainers. These are a few goals that I think are quite simple to implement. My reason for prioritizing them as minimum achievable is to solve the problem of userbase for metakgp. We need more and more tools that targets most of KGP. A rule of thumb would be that develop something that’d be used by atleast 3000 people. The essential package: A compilation of all tools and platforms that every KGPian will need. As solo projects, they might loose lustre, but as a consolidated package, as a onestop shop, metakgp can get more users.Cab Pooling: A more efficient method of pooling. It’ll have a number of cab drivers’ numbers. The website will have chat rooms for discussion, comment section for plans that anyone can initiate, and an interactive display (could be calendar based) for visualizing.Book Sharing: Relevance is questionable in the age of kindles and digital content. But nevertheless, this could be useful in community engagement.Market Place: a revamp of Centrale, that’ll be easier to use and search. A free/donate  section of this marketplace can be used for discarding old items, which others can reuse. The essential package: A compilation of all tools and platforms that every KGPian will need.

I believe with more women on board, we can get a different perspective at solutions. I believe we need to start off with inviting our female friends first to open metakgp meetups. Hackathons for women would definitely be a plus. I see PR as an issue which hampers the reach of our works. I understand that Public Relations is a difficult and sensitive issue (too much of it looks bad, very little of it might not be appealing). I honestly do not know how to publicize our works for an effective reach. I believe that rather than stressing on publicizing, we need to create such good and useful products that people would spread it themselves, after all there’s nothing like word of mouth, is there? I envision a social platform, an extension/compilations of metakgp’s works, for KGPians that they would use everyday, analogous to DC++. I like that you have created a list of minimum achievable goals. I'll useAmrav's SCAMPguidelines to rate each part of the proposal. All three sub parts of the essential package will be helpful and if we they critical mass, they can be very impactful too. I'll give3.5 in alignment'. You should spend more time working on the feasibility of the proposal. Searching for \"Open Source Cab Sharing tools\" on Google gives me a couple of results will be similar for \"Open Source Book Sharing portal\" and \"Open Source Market Place\". You should try to figure out how good are these tools and do we actually need to implement these tools by ourselves. If existing tools are good enough then the task is easy, otherwise a lot of effort will go into building them.2.5 for effectiveness. The proposal isn't well calibrated. We already have platforms which provides the proposed functionalities to an extent, we have KGP Centrale which can server for all three, we carbuk.com for cab sharing, there is minimal discussion about how building our own platform improves upon existing platform. So,1.5 in Calibration of the project to failure. The proposal is measurable, we either have \"The Essential Package\" or we don't, but it is hard to measure the quality and impact of the package. Hence3 in measurableness. In the scheme I think point d is not relevant, each department can maintain\ntheir communication channel, we don't need to get involved with that. Overall\nthis can be something very helpful but something that can be very hard to pull\noff, this will require a lot of follow up and lot of pestering of the\ndepartment society representative. You should also think about why would a\ndepartment representative do the thing (s)he is supposed to do. Sometimes just\nbeing asked to do something is good enough, other times you might have to put\nspecific incentives, maybe certificates or publicity. You should also talk with\nsome HOD to see if they can offer any support. To make this proposal a success\nyour people skill will matter a lot. Measurable: 2.5 somewhat measurable. Calibrated: 1 don't discuss possibility of failure Aligned: 4 it would be awesome if it works out Effective: 2 The goal is defined but there is no clear time frame or clear step. --Hargup(talk) 22:37, 18 March 2017 (IST) (1a) and (1c) will be somewhat tackled during the InterIIT Tech Meet 2017 - however, a more scalable and practical solution that can be put to use for fellow KGPians is something that has to be done, outside of the Tech Meet. (1b) was already discussed by @icyflame and @chebhyshev on our Slack group - and the common opinion that came out during the discussion was that, most people don't prefer to share their books - as they don't want their book to be mistreated (say, chips' oil stains on the page corners). (1b) might again be tackled during the InterIIT Tech Meet 2017. I would just like to share the common opinion we had while discussing about it's practicality - if KGPian societies aren't convinced to put up their events on facebook, then what would convince them to add their events to our portal? So, can you clarify whether you have a tweaked-Naarad in mind to scrape facebook KGPian events, or a web application built from scratch with posting access to the society Governors / GSecs at the back of your mind? --Athityakumar(talk) 02:17, 19 March 2017 (IST) I am thinking that we'll initially scrape from naarad, or rather manually fill them. But that's not the end goal, we'll ask the societies to post themselves. Facebook reach is allright, but there's no messenger bot that notifies people who've selectedgoingfor an event. Selective feed for events is new. I understand many of my proposals are actually discussed over the months on the group. I have just prioritzed them to execute. Its a delight that many of the plans will be built for the dashboard event for Inter IIT Tech Meet. I would like your help in scaling it further. They book sharing could be limited and may not have 3000 users, may not be 300 also. But I'd still like to push for plans that involve community interaction. The book sharing tool isn't a massive project, it can be realeased in 2-3 days. All for the purpose of attracting users for using any of the tools. --Arunpatro(talk) 14:26, 19 March 2017 (IST)"

        "content": "Metakgp:Old Governance Model/Election March 2017/SOP Ayush Goyal I am a second year undergraduate student of the Department of Agricultural and Food Engineering. I am also Executive Head (Projects and Open Source) atKharagpur Open Source Society. I started contributing to the metakgp wiki from April 2016, and from then I have made some or the other edits on the wiki. All my wiki contribution can be seenhere. I majorly contributed on the projectNaarad, of which I am the maintainer now. I have also contributed to five months of the server pricing. I see metakgp as a group where one can find a lot of interesting people to interact with and learn. Metakgp is not just another “coding” society(which a lot of people think it is ), it is a lot more than that. It is a place where one can find proper guidance,support, resources to bring an idea to life. One of the major problem with metakgp right now is gender diversity. There are very less or I can say negligible female contributors. Recently, there had been quite an interesting discussion to overcome this problem and I think this problem will soon be resolved. Secondly, the number of “active” contributors in metakgp is very less. Like currently there are 150+ members on metakgp slack of which hardly 10 or 20 people actually contribute which is very less. Plans and proposals as a maintainer Increasing the scope of Metakgp Currently a lot of people thinks of metakgp as only coding related organisation which is not the case. For example , a lot of people are not aware of the book-club. So, to overcome this I will arrange weekly book-club meetups and try to have discussion related to it in general or random channel. So that everyone know it exists. Involving more people to contribute Our major projects such as Wiki, MFQP are community driven and to keep them alive we need to see that we are getting active contributions for them. Only a small fraction of people contribute to make them better while a lot of people use them. So, to overcome this situation I propose to have more editathons and in-person events and also in every event we should tell why everyoneshouldcontribute towards these projects. Getting a professor as our mentor To increase the scope of metakgp and for smoothly conducting on campus events we really need a professor to back us up. So, after discussing with everyone who that professor should be we can contact him/her. As it is said that you can make an awesome thing but if no one uses it than it is a waste. So we need to ensure that metakgp is publicised properly among everyone in KGP. For this I will start with asking the VP Gymkhana to give a short introduction to the first years during the orientation programme and also ask people at Student Welfare Group to tell about metakgp in the information brochure and tell about us in their Campus tour. I'm usingAmrav's SCAMPguidelines to rate each part of the proposal. Increasing the scope of Metakgp Measurable: 1.5 it is almost impossible to measure the success of your proposal after your term is over. Calibrated: 1 the proposal doesn't discuss possibility of failure but\nthat is also because of its vagueness. It is hard to think fail scenario when\nit hard to define failure (or success). Aligned: 2 the scope of metakgp is pretty wide already, I don't there is a need to increase it further. Coherence: 2 The proposal is largely vague Effective: 1.5 I don't think conducting weekly book-club meets will be sufficient in attracting non coders to metakgp. Involving more people to contribute Measurable: 2.5 hard to measure Calibration: 1 doesn't talk about why editathons might not work, which I think isn't too much of an issue here. Aligned: 4 if this works it can be awesome, a single new dedicated contributor can transform the community. New people are ones who will take things up for metakgp in the future, it is very important to bring them in and nurture them. effectiveness: 3 I think \"regular\" editathons and in-person events can be an effective way to bring new people in. Coherence: 3 The goal and step are broadly defined. Getting a professor as our mentor Measurable: 3.5, after the term, the professor is either there or not, though it might not be clear if (s)he is mentoring us or not Calibration: 1 doesn't talk about failure Coherence: 2 I think the steps to getting a professor in are clear (but implicit, just talk to them). The goals of bringing in the professor are not clearly defined. Aligned: 1.5 it is more important to get the right professor than getting a professor. A bad professor can actively harm the community by unnecessary bossing and interfering. effectiveness: 2 I think most professor don't have time or enthusiasm to get involved in communities like ours. Even if they are enthusiastic they might not turn out to be effective mentors because of lack of experience in working with communities like ours. Calibration: 1 proposal doesn't talk about failure, here the failure modes are also very apparent, the VP, SWG or both might decline to cooperate Coherence: 3.5 the goal and the steps are well defined Aligned: 3.5 publicity not only brings us new contributors but it also increases the impact of existing projects. effectiveness: 3 both of the defined steps can be very effective. --Hargup(talk) 23:57, 18 March 2017 (IST) (Siddharth, @icyflame on Slack): 1.start with asking the VP Gymkhana to give a short introduction to the first years during the orientation programme: I see where you are coming from, but what incentives do you plan to offer to the VP for mentioning Metakgp? Basically, what's going to be your pitch? 2.Getting a professor as our mentor: Yeah, we should work on this no matter if you get elected or not. We already planned and failed once, let's not let it happen once more! 3.Involving more people to contribute: Considering that the attendance to the in-person events is so less, how do you plan to get the message out? Maybe the stickers and posters idea that Naresh suggested in his SOP can be added to yours, and we can get better results? I am just brain storming here. 4.Increasing the scope of Metakgp: You should talk a bit more about _why_ the book club doesn't meet as often as you suggest. --Icyflame(talk) 20:35, 19 March 2017 (IST)"

        "content": "Metakgp:Old Governance Model/Election March 2017/SOP Naresh R I amNaresh (13CS30024), dual degree student in Computer Science and Engineering currently in my fourth year. I have tried to justify and highlight some of the key aspects that I consider crucial for a future maintainer from MetaKGP. I have been active on MetaKGP’s discussion forums for about a year now, and have recently started actively participating and contributing as well. A fixto improveNaarad, that removes a deprecated dependency and plugged in to make use of Facebook's Graph API directly. I am currently in talks with existing members regarding a proposal for several significant changes to its existing model. As a part of InterIIT-Tech’s ‘Dashboard’ problem statement, I am also working on adding course reviews to Wiki, fixing the broken search function on mfqp, building a web-interface for gyft and making kgp_cab_centrale a reality. In an attempt to save the reader from an unattractive huge wall of text, I have divided this SOP into3 sections - ‘Introduction’, ‘past experience’ and ‘plans as a maintainer’, where I have tried to concisely, but also exhaustively answer some questions one might expect a future maintainer at MetaKGP to answer now. I have subdivided the individual sections intoabstract ideas, as well as solutions tospecific goalsthat I intend to tackle. All specific goals are marked with a timeline, with a few goals marked as\"Minimum Achievable Goal\" (or \"<MAG>\" in short)that I will seek to complete as a bare-minimum during my term as a maintainer. Feel free to skip sections that might be irrelevant. I have previously taken up several administrative roles, with significant contributions summarized below: Joined in my second year, and still active as a senior editor. Was one of the only five 3rd years who were in charge of all activities at TLS during 2015-2016. Was directly involved in management of finances, interactions with Gymkhana for sanctioning of funds and permissions for 2 of the flagship events at TLS - Kavya Sandhya and Kavyanjali and for production & distribution of Alankaar (annual magazine distributed to the graduating batch on Convocation day) during my tenure (2015-2016). Was solely responsible for all interactions with the Spring Fest team for allocation & setup of TLS' stall at the arena, judge selection and reception, management of the team and resources for all events associated with TLS at Spring Fest, 2016. Personal mentor for several members from the junior batches to help them with their works and issues within and outside TLS. Headed the selection panel for English team for the 2015 and 2016 sessions. Active for the entirety of my first and second years at KGP, I was directly involved with all major activities taken up by CodeClub. Was solely responsible for bringing in sponsorship in the form of cash / goodies from 7 distinct sponsors for Bitwise, the annual CSE departmental fest, 2014 and 2015 included. With absolutely no help fromanyof my peers, conducted an introductory seminar for the CSE '15 batch at LBS hall, and introduced them to CodeClub. During my second year, headed meetings with the then first year members and coordinated with them for the conduction of fortnightly CodeNite competitions and orchestration of events at Bitwise. Conducted workshops on the polymer project and Android design with Gaurav Jain (Google Student Ambassador, 2014) and Avijit Ghosh (now part of KOSS) Was responsible for creating the blog posts to be sent to Google at the end of each event. For the first time, currently communicating and collaborating with 23 members from a technical point of view for OpenSoft '17. I have worked as a backend intern atezDI, Ahmedabadlast summer, and will be joiningIntuit, Bangaloreas an intern this summer. I have also worked with theAutonomous Underwater Vehicle groupfor a year, where I was a part of the software team. Most of my work there was focused on the image processing aspects of the bot. Mymajor takeawaysfrom my past experiences include Elimination of all fear ofpublic speaking, having taken part in dramatics / hosted events as a speaker at Kalidas auditorium, Vikramshila, SF arena and various events with TLS in smaller gatherings around the campus. Familiarity with the workflow for most activities across KGP. Built a good rapport with students from all years, involved in a wide range of activities across the campus. I strongly believe MetaKGP is very different from most student groups in campus in the way thatMetaKGP does not have a hierarchyin terms of how the members collaborate on some work, and there is no unjust distribution of responsibilities between them. All members are treated equal, in terms of their opinions, their ideas and their work. I’ll consider it high priority to keep it this way, and make it my duty to make sure any decisions are taken with the consensus of the group as a whole. In accordance with the true spirit of Free and Open Source that MetaKGP as a community believes in, all decisions and participation will be transparent, and can at any point be brought up for questioning by someone with an opposing view that eventually can everyone agrees upon. <MAG, 4 months>: Theheavily skewed sex ratioin MetaKGP makes it a very hostile environment for women who might be interested in joining, but feel intimidated by the same. This is a very important problem to tackle. Despite having been in similar situations in other societies, I cannot propose a magical solution to improve this situation.The best we could do now is try!A recent discussion on Slack initiated by one of the female members brought to light a women’s perspective on the issue, and some possible measures were suggested,as summarised here. In very short terms, the key idea would be to experiment with different women-focused events that could introduce them to 'programming-for-leisure' and to MetaKGP’s vision, andhopefullyattract initial women participants to MetaKGP. Once done, their feedback cab be taken and iteratively reworked upon to reach out to more women in KGP. <MAG, 4 months>: Theheavily skewed sex ratioin MetaKGP makes it a very hostile environment for women who might be interested in joining, but feel intimidated by the same.

So, I’d like to establish one layer of ‘interested volunteers’ who could help with moderating all the content there. This group will be dynamic and can change every month. Incentives you ask? Treats! In terms of participation, there are several aspects to look into. As of now, described in a crude manner, MetaKGP ismostlya community of ‘programmers’ building projects that help the community at large in KGP with different facets of their life here. My vision of MetaKGP is to maintain this sanctity, but at the same time, evolve into something that helps introduce the people in KGP to the joys of programming, problem solving and collaborating. <MAG, first month of autumn semester>: The single greatest way toincrease the visibilityof a ‘society’ in KGP would be to get a proper introductory seminar in the beginning of every academic year. So, I shall definitely be pushing for one of these early August, so it becomes easy to get the attention of first years in KGP. TSG is currently involved in allotting slots to societies for this purpose during the period and hence I shall attempt to get in touch with the newly elected GSec handling this by mid-July. Getting people to this event can begreatlyboosted by a one-timewing-publiin their halls of residence, and doesn't need more than 3 hours of work. <MAG, first month of autumn semester>: The single greatest way toincrease the visibilityof a ‘society’ in KGP would be to get a proper introductory seminar in the beginning of every academic year.

MetaKGP has already started on it’s path to achieving this with ‘Hack day’ and various other meetups and as a first step I shall strive to ‘formalize’ this, so as to make it regular instead of haphazard events. This can be achieved with the help of a subset of the existing community, aka thevolunteers. This would be a dynamic group that can help the maintainer(s) with organizing and conducting these events. Well ahead of the start of every event, there shall also be a request for 'interested mentors'who might be interested in helping the students and/or sharing their learning and knowledge, technical or otherwise, with the participants before and during the hackathon. A short talk on a topic / framework of choice by a mentor a few hours / days before the hackathon and suggesting students tooptionallypick up their new gained knowledge through the talk for the hackathon will help with greater participation from the inexperienced programmers. The involvement of mentors also motivates more students to take part, as they could gain the experience of working alongside these mentors. <MAG, every 2 months>: I strongly believehackathonsare a great way to collaborate and get projects off to a great start, thanks to the format and the promise of a deadline.

A short talk on a topic / framework of choice by a mentor a few hours / days before the hackathon and suggesting students tooptionallypick up their new gained knowledge through the talk for the hackathon will help with greater participation from the inexperienced programmers. The involvement of mentors also motivates more students to take part, as they could gain the experience of working alongside these mentors. <no timeline>: As an addition to the previous point, I will be attempting to get MLH (or a similar organisation) that supportsstudent-conducted hackathonsacross the globe to sponsor atleast one event each year. I wrote a not-so-impressive rant last year on a Facebook comment on the KGP logical group regarding Hackathon culture in KGP. But for some reason, the original post was deleted by the admin.Here’s a copy, in case you’d like to have a look. The reason I keep this as a separate point is the fact that this might easily fail, since MLH has only now begun sponsoring hackathons in Asia. <no timeline>: As an addition to the previous point, I will be attempting to get MLH (or a similar organisation) that supportsstudent-conducted hackathonsacross the globe to sponsor atleast one event each year.

While this sounds highly ambitious, a quick-fire way for this would be to get quirky stickers that can be stuck around campus. (Probably bad) examples:Unable to find Ashim's centeen's number? MetaKGP! Need guidance preparing for GRE? MetaKGP! Confused about subject registrations? MetaKGP! Need to learn more about KGP? MetaKGP!!!Stickers are a relatively cheap investment to make and can be stuck at different canteens and hotspots around the campus. Mid-way between posters ornothing, thismightjust work. <MAG, 1 year>: Greater visibility of the Wiki, and the push for more users and content is something I'd consider highly essential, and the key idea for getting more contributors for the Wiki would be toconvert MetaKGP into a verbwithin KGP.

This should be the easier amongst all the responsibilities. I’ve done numerous projects in my 4 years here, and have gained enough technical knowledge to atleast understand the technicalities involved with a lot of the existing MetaKGP projects, and in a position to either directly or indirectly help a member when in dilemma or is facing any issue. While there are a lot of ideas for improvements and changes to current projects, those are ones I can carry on even without having to be a maintainer and have thus kept them away from this SOP. Managing deployment of the Wiki and other projects and utilisation of the server is already well established, and is managed by several members within the organisation and needs no change as it is. <MAG, once every year>: \"Brainstorm KGP!\" (for the lack of a better name) would be an online push for great ideas andmoonshotsthat the general public (and members of MetaKGP) can add to a Wiki page, that they'd like to see MetaKGP work on. This could generate a very interesting influx of ideas from the diverse public that could be different from the demographic of existing members. <MAG, once every year>: \"Brainstorm KGP!\" (for the lack of a better name) would be an online push for great ideas andmoonshotsthat the general public (and members of MetaKGP) can add to a Wiki page, that they'd like to see MetaKGP work on.

While most of the current projects are done end-to-end, I’d like to separate it out in such a way that there is a central API created by MetaKGP that startups and students can utilise in their projects. There are a lot of loose ends on this idea that have to be discussed before carrying on. This is a moonshot. I will be pushing for this discussion regardless of whether or not I’m a maintainer. <1 year>: One grand plan I have is to create anAPI for all things KGP.

While not objectively gauged, I believe KGP's bandwidth is currently throttled by YouTube traffic, and solving this problem can greatly reduce network load, and in-turn increase internet speeds. The major problem with this? This goes directly against YouTube's TOC that states \"no rights or licenses are granted to reproduce or distribute audiovisual content or make audiovisual content available in any manner other than through the use of the YouTube API Services in accordance with the Agreement\". Hence, bound to fail for this reason.

As a personal task, I’ll seek toreview, improve and add Wikicontent as and when I can, and ensure the quality of the Wiki is ever sublime. I can also take responsibility, with the help of other members as well, for managing the Facebook page and other PR work that is usually done on a regular basis. Apart from this, getting to know other members personally is always fun and refreshing! So regular meetups to discuss personal interests, books, poems, songs, and just about everything under the sky isA MUST.Bakar, treats and more bakar! I am currently in my 4th year, and in the event that I'm forced to sit for placements (read as 'No Pre-Placement Offer), I might be caught up with my preparations during the Autumn 2017 semester andcouldslow down on my activities as a maintainer. If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. Email:[email protected]|[email protected] Personal site (Last updated: October 27, 2016):http://ghostwriternr.me/ The idea of conductingtalks before the hackathonswas incorporated into the SOP after suggestions from Rishabh Madan and Siddharth Kannan during a meetup. One important point that I had missed as an oversight during my initial draft of the SOP is the push for getting aprofessor as a mentorfor MetaKGP. This has been covered in proposals by most other contestants, and is something I'd be in strong support for, irrespective of whether or not I'm a maintainer. Indian Copyright Act 1957 Section 52 (1) (c) says (Seehttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Indian_Copyright_Law#CHAPTER_XI_:_INFRINGEMENT_OF_COPYRIGHT); Providing a cache is considered transient storage and YouTube has not\nexplicitly prohibited it and hence arguably is not illegal. If YouTube comes to\nyou complaining about your cacher, stop offering it, period. In intellectual\nproperty law, for every act you will find a section in the law which says it is\nillegal and a section which will say it is not. So don't preemptively assume\nthat something you are doing is illegal. On a side note, providing exception for transient storage is important because\notherwise network providers will be regularly sued for copyright infringement.\nAnother thing you can do is claim that you are only providing the cache\nsoftware and it the people using the caching software who are doing an illegal\nact not you. It is like being sued for selling a knife which is used to commit\na murder. It doesn't mean that you have no liability but that is determined by\ncomplicated rules of secondary liability which I won't go into. Anyway the\npoint is that you can argue that what you are doing is legal, and it is legal unless\nthe courts says otherwise. BTW obligatory,I am not a lawyer and this is not a legal advice. --Hargup(talk) 01:49, 19 March 2017 (IST) I don't think we should worry about legality here. In most cases like these, Youtube, Google, etc simply stop giving API/data access to Extensions, OAuth sign-ins and other content just forviolating terms of service.Violating terms of service in itself isn't illegal.So we shouldn't be worried about Youtube suing us, they cannot counter the Fair Use doctrine but we may violate the law bybypassing technical barrier. --Arunpatro(talk) 02:18, 19 March 2017 (IST) I appreciate that you have explicitly written about upholding transparency in\nmetakgp. Fixing metakgp's gender ratioI appreciate your intentions and your\nattempts to characterize the problem and providing a summary of the discussion\non including more women in metakgp. Establishing one-layer of interested volunteers: The proposal isn't well\narticulated, how will you establish this layer, exactly what will be its role.\nBecause of its vague nature it is also hard to judge the failure of success of\nthis after end of your term. I also don't understand<every month>tag in\nthis proposal. Though if it is done \"right\" it can be helpful. Here are mySCAMPscore for this proposal. Calibrated: 1 Doesn't discuss possibility of failure increasing visibility by intro seminar Increasing visibility is definitely important and conducting an intro seminar\nlooks like a good way to do it. Calibrated: 1 your talking about talking to GSec's and all but we might\nnot get a slot, so we need to find an alternative. Another failure mode is lack\nof publicity about the even itself. If no one knows about the event no one\ncomes to it, think about how you will handle that. I really like this idea, as you said stickers are cheap and can be very\neffective. Rather than doing this sometime in next year you should do this as\nsoon as your term start. We can order stickers online with websites likehttp://www.inkprint.in/stickers-labels, I'm sure we'll be able to find shops\nwhich can print stickers locally. Measurable: 2 or 4 depending on what the proposal is, if the proposal is\nto make \"MetaKGP into a verb\", then I highly doubt we can measure it, but if\nthe proposal is print and put stickers in various places on campus, then that\ncan be measured very easily. Coherence: 3.5 (refer to the comment in measurable) Calibrated: 2.5 There isn't much which can fail here --Hargup(talk) 00:59, 20 March 2017 (IST) (Siddharth, @icyflame on Slack): Overall, I like this SOP, I will only put forth my thoughts on some of the proposals: 1.heavily skewed sex ratio: I liked your approach to this on Slack and here as well. I also believe that \"events that could introduce them to 'programming-for-leisure'\" are very important. (Not just for women, but for _everyone_) The only way to solve this problem, is to takesomeinitiative and see the results for that. And then work from there. 2.Seminar in Autumn for first years: again, I like this idea. Your approach to it is good, and we will probably take it up, no matter if you are elected as the maintainer or not. I believe that your previous experience as TLS governor and your contacts in TSG will be very helpful for this process. So, you might be a goodpoint manfor this proposal. 3.hackathons: I have several misgivings about hackathons. The Hack days were great, but a key feature that was missing in them were theshort talksgiven by members on something that they are working on right now, or something that they learned and would like to share with other people (could be papers, a problem with your computer you solved, Ops issue, books if people are so inclined, etc). 20 minutes or so would be enough, and this would be a great way to get people to start speaking about what they are doing and also learn a lot about a variety of projects. TL; DR: Hackathons can be great when done right. But they really skew the audience against attending the next one if the one they attended sucked. 4.Metakgp as a verb: Might want to keep in mind that Google as a verb is more popular, so maybe we could try telling peopleGoogle forPFC Phone number MetakgpThat google search's first result was the Metakgp Wiki page for PFC and the third entry was Yellow pages on Metakgp. (I don't use Google as my primary search engine) This brings up slightly better search results thanPFC Phone number IIT Kharagpur, which has it's third page as the PFC page on the wiki. 5.Revival of existing projects: Hmm, very exciting! Something to keep in mind: the technical cost ofgetting startedwith such projects is quite high, so I hope that you can take out the time to do it. You should also mention in the SOP that you will have your placements in December and your involvementmightbe less if you feel so. Of course, if you don't feel so you should say that. I am speaking from past experience with CS seniors in their placement semester. --Icyflame(talk) 20:23, 19 March 2017 (IST)"

        "content": "Metakgp:Old Governance Model/Election March 2017/SOP Nishant Nikhil Third year undergraduate studentDepartment of Mathematics Contributions:Contribution to wiki can be found at thislink. Andgyftwas my implementation of a small idea, then later I gave the repo rights to MetaKGP. Furthermore in Kharagpur Open Source Society, during selections for the team. I and Himanshu Mishra co-ideated contribution to wiki as one of the task to be completed for getting selected. (Though it had mixed results as there were some very bad edits, I wont encourage this sort of event in near future). I have always thought of MetaKGP as a place where artists interact (though much of our work is tech-related we might call them tech-savvy artists). But the things with artists are that they get bored easily. And artists never stay at the place where they get bored. So when MetaKGP started there were regular meetups then slowly the number of meetups dwindled down. My best memory of MetaKGP is still the hackathon part and maybe second to it would be one of the meetings where we decided about “gyft”. (Vikrant suggested me to get an Android app for it, but after making the “gyft” python app I never got the encouragement to make an android app) Is MetaKGP slack channel boring? No. I come once in a while and always get to see some pretty awesome posts in the slack channel. But the thing is the posts are usually from same people and I have this image in my mind where I associate MetaKGP only with *few* people. To tackle this I thought maybe KGPians are not yet habituated with slack. So I made a facebook group,ShowKGPand yes it is quite on track. Though most of the posts are from few people only(maybe it also follows a normal curve), but I see new users posting something and commenting something everyday and this is what I needed. (Note: The main motive behind this group can be summed up in a conversation, one person talks to other and says: Oh it is awesome and so simple, I can sum it up in one word: Sharing! Well in my personal opinion I think that coming to IIT has put me with some nice people and nothing else. And the more I share the more they would share with me and this way I grow). But we are artists and can always do something better, so how can we tackle this thing (the biasedness of KGP junta towards facebook) ?In my opinion, Slack is a better channel than facebook for discussions (given the new threads feature). But someone needs to put some conversation on the table. (People see and then people do, this is my personal experience with ShowKGP (initial few posts were just from the admins and admins keep posting interesting stuff once in a while)). So in nutshell: So if we have good discussionsregularlyon slack, interested users would come and neverleave.Even though getting a good user base to slack is a far fetched dream. One more point: In first year I stumbled upon HackerNews. Even though people said its UI is not good, see Quora and other sites. I got stuck to it because interested users come and never leave. I can post stuffs, but this can be done without standing for election. Well! I would act as a moderator for the stuff and being a little more responsible than an average userI would make sure that new users feel comfortable and their posts do not go neglected and I would see that there is only “healthy” discussions going on. I think artists do projects only for themselves and not others (unless it is a job), I recently made a chrome extension for dynamic queuing in YouTube becauseIwanted that. So where does MetaKGP comes in picture ? Ideas!Yes people get ideas when they talk to other people or when they see other people's’ projects. I got the idea for ‘gyft’ only after I saw ‘mftp’. And what is needed for this ? Better Discussions and interesting meetups. Organizing talks. Yes talks! They are the best thing to showcase what you have done and mostly juniors are more ready for talks than meetups and for a developer this is one of the best way to showcase your talent and the problems you faced. Personally I know that a project has come in some XY shape but I am more interested in how it changed from some AB shape to CD to .. to XY. And this is where “talks from developers” comes in. Though I want to change it from “developers” to “artists”.I would make sure that there are talks from some painter, some debater and etc etc, of course they would also be a part of MetaKGP."

        "content": "Metakgp:Old Governance Model/Election March 2017/SOP Pranit Bauva I haven’t been a regular contributor but I have a few commits here and there on some repositories. I havesome editson the wiki too. None. I was quite busy this year with other activities in campus. Though I would be really looking forward to maintain some abandoned projects. I see MetaKGP as a community where one can find awesome and interested people to kick off a personal project, learn lots of different skills, and get a good audience to launch their project for the KGP junta. I also see MetaKGP’s wiki as a knowledge hub wherein the senior batches can pass the knowledge to their junior batches without much loss of knowledge. The major focus of MetaKGP should be to craft quality projects (in terms of code, usability, and impact) which can be used by the current as well as the future batches of IIT KGP. I also see MetaKGP as a central body where people from diverse backgrounds can come together and share knowledge. Just Talk about metaKGP:We should encourage all metaKGP members to talk more about what they are doing as a part of metaKGP, what it is and more things. The biggest problem that we are facing is that not a lot of people know about this. People are always willing to share their knowledge (especially KGP junta) but they just need thatspark.Slipping the name metaKGPin various occasions just casually isactually the wayto do this rather than “keeping a meeting to discuss about metaKGP”. For eg. When I meet a group of people for dinner or beer, I can just slip into the conversation in that “I am working on XXX project because I wanted to learn a new thing which will also help other KGP junta”. Especially when interacting with juniors, this is really important. The junior batcheswant to workwith senior batches and this is a extremely good opportunity for interaction. This will of course have much bigger impact than more wiki edits or more people using our project. It will also motivate people to look into the hoods (and when they do that, I am pretty sure they will like the whole idea) which can in turn help us with lots of more things.

It will also motivate people to look into the hoods (and when they do that, I am pretty sure they will like the whole idea) which can in turn help us with lots of more things. Increase the reach of our projects Currently our mfqp project has a good reach but our other projects are only used a very few people outside our community. Reaching out to the masses is extremely important in order for the project to create a big impact. There is nothing called as “too much knowledge”. I will focus on having more editathons. In fact just having more editathons isn’t really enough, we should also have more people involved in those editathons. If we have like 1 per month next semester, then I guess we will be easily able to have 3 at least (considering mid sem, end sem, and DP break). Let's say we manage to pull off 6 hrs (of direct writing time) then we can easily generate content of 3-5 pages (ie. 1000 words). And let's say 15 people attend it then around 15,000 words per editathon. So in the next semester we can have around 50,000 words added in our wiki. In the next three months (which would be in summers), I don't think I will be accurately able to determine, since there are varied burdens in different internships and there is still some communication gap. It is very important to involve the new junior batches into the metaKGP community right from the start otherwise we will soon fall short of enthusiastic people. Right now, there are extremely few 2nd and 3rd years involved and soon if actions aren’t taken, this will create a void which will result in deterioration of the whole project. The new freshers are always quite enthusiastic and we could really tap that resource. Getting non-programmers interested in metaKGP As of right now, we generally don’t attract people outside the “programmers” community of KGP. Since metaKGP isn’t really restricted to just programmers, we should make efforts to involve other people too in our day to day activities. I actually have a lot on my plate for the coming semester. I will be quite free in my 6th semester. I am in Robotix, Swarm and KOSS. I had a talk with Harsh about it and I informed him that it would be good if you could find a replacement for me. This semester and the coming, I have more of managerial job roles and being the maintainer would add in those. I would really prefer to code more this and coming semester. After my 5th semester, I would be more than happy to pick up a managerial job role. I'm usingSCAMPguidelines to rate parts of the proposal. Measurable: 1.5 After the term is over hard to agree upon if you have \"talked about metaKGP\" Aligned: 2.5 The aim of the proposal is to increase the reach of metakgp\nand get new people. The impact can be high if those get deeply involved then\nthe impact of this proposal can be very high but getting people deeply involved\nneeds much more than just talking about metakgp. Hence, the proposal is weakly\nimpactful if done properly. Coherence: 3.5 The proposal is simple and have given enough details. Calibrated: 1 doesn't talk about fail scenarios and doesn't discuss why\n\"just talking about metakgp\" might not be enough. All the four plans, increasing reach of metakgp, more editathons, involving\nnew junior batches, getting non-programmers interested in metaKGP, have a basic\nweakness that they don't discuss how you will do the proposed thing. Also there\nare no measurable goals and discussion about why the current problem exist.\nHere is what you should do: If you think we should get more non-programmers, talk to some non-programmers\nand find out why they don't participate in metakgp. Similarly talk to 2nd and\n3rd years who are involved and figure out how did they get involved and maybe\nreproduce the process, also talk with other 2 and 3rd years, who know about\nmetakgp and ask what's stoping them from getting involved in metakgp. Based on\nthis feedback form your strategy. Right now these plans are just an aim. --Hargup(talk) 18:44, 19 March 2017 (IST)"

I have been associated with MetaKGP for almost a year now( zorroblue is my nick). I made a few contributions to MetaKGP. I made MetaBot as part of a hackathon, which is now a project under MetaKGP of which I am one of the maintainers. I have written small scripts related to web-scraping in my initial days. On the wiki, I made a few edits on the BARC page and have a basic understanding of how the wiki editing works for a layman. Along with Harsh, I tried holding a meeting with the Gymkhana and societies like BARC on how to use the wiki. However it didn't materialise due to lack of follow-up from both sides. MetaKGP has to be one of the best groups in KGP where actual work is done and the participation is open to all. All of us members would want it to remain that way always. I don't see many people using it except for mfqp before exams, so I think we should make more people aware of what we are and we do. These are my ideas which I'll try to do (irrespective of whether I end up being a maintainer or not) 1. I am working on a cab sharing platform for Inter IIT right now. I'll try to make it a full-fledged project under MetaKGP. 2. Organising an intro seminar next year(preferrably in the Autumn sem) . This is something which most members of MetaKGP want, so I'll try co-ordinating with fellow members in making a seminar and introduce Kgpians to MetaKGP and its projects. 3. I want to bring in a better attribution system to project contributors. It can be a wiki page with a list of contributors too. Recognition is an important driving force for most contributors and this can help increase contribution to our projects. 4. We can organise the meeting with the Gymkhana and \"teach\" them how to use the wiki. So GC events can be updated directly by them. Before considering to vote for me, I also want to tell that I am quite busy this semester with the hectic course work and other commitments , so I might not be able to work to my full potential this sem. I think I need to tell this before you consider voting for me :) To summarize, you have four proposals: Better Attribution system for wiki Teaching Gymkhana how to use wiki Cab sharing portalis also discussed byArun.\nAs I told him, you should do a survey of existing open source cab sharing\nportal and figure out why and why/not they fulfil our needs. Additionally,\nplease do all the development in open, that is, rather than presenting the\nproduct after it is done, keep it open and engage the community right from the\nbeginning. I know this can be somewhat uncomfortable but I believe this will be\nbetter for the product and the for the community. Nareshalso discussed conducting anintro seminarto increase the reach of metakgp. My\ncomments are same, think about how will you do the publicity for the event and\nhow will you manage to the get the slot. Better Attribution System for wiki: I'm glad you brought this up. Right\nnow the attribution is mainly in the history section which I guess no one looks\ninto. In some \"How to\" articles we have manually added the names of\ncontributors, and we tagged the authors while announcing the page. We also aContribution Scorespage, but it sits in a\nobscure corner of the wiki. You can try having a \"Contributor of the month\"\nkind of thing to attract more contributors. Teaching Gymkhana how to use wiki: Along with this you should try to\nbuild a system where updating GC score on metakgp becomes formal or informal\nduty of the gymkhana secys, then teaching them how to use wiki will be very\nvaluable. --Hargup(talk) 19:50, 19 March 2017 (IST)"

My slack (and Github) handle:@americast I was introduced to metaKGP by my mentor soon after coming to KGP. Since then, I have\ntried to remain in the major discussion of the meta-X projects so that I could be of help,\nwhenever required. I also became the top contributor of metaKGP during Kharagpur\nWinter of Code 2016. Here are the links to some of my contributions: - https://wiki.metakgp.org/index.php?title=How_to_install_Ubuntu_as_Dual_Boot&o https://github.com/metakgp/naarad-source/commits/master?author=americast Outside metaKGP, I am a member of Kharagpur Open Source Society (KOSS), Kharagpur\nRoboSoccer Students’ Group (KRSSG) and Swarm Robotics. According to me metaKGP is a medium through which KGPians can satisfy their hunger of\ngiving back to KGP and KGPians. This is achieved by sharing information via the metaKGP\nwiki or assisting in the form of code in various meta-X projects. Not only that, metaKGP\nbelieves in making such codes open source so that every one can collaborate and become\na part of the community. MetaKGP does not have the concept of“joining”or“leaving”. Anyone can become a part of it by their contributions. Hence, the association of metaKGP contributors is“loose”. It\nis supposed to be that way. But, a strong bond among a few people, which is required to\nkeep it moving at all times, is what metaKGP lacks. I hope we will be able to make this up\nwith the election of maintainers. It will help to keep some people responsible for\nwhatever is happening around, all the time. As for the future, I wish to see“metaKGP”become a word of mouth in IIT KGP. Plans and proposals as a maintainer MetaKGP is not that popular among KGPians. Most freshers and post-graduates haven't\neven heard of metaKGP. a. I believe conducting events makes a community popular. Hence, I would\nrecommend conducting a Hackday within a month after freshers OP, with\nelaborately designed posters, illustrating clearly what a Hackday is. b. Making metaKGP popular in social media with assistance from other popular\ngroups/societies in KGP. They could help us by popularising metaKGP on social\nmedia and by enrolling their societies into various metaKGP projects (like Naarad\nand Calendar (upcoming)). Moreover, metaKGP should not be introduced as a \"society\" to newcomers. It should be made clear that it is a community which anyone can be a part of. MetaKGP services should never go down In case of an inevitable failure, bringing the\nservice back to life should be the first priority. This may be achieved by: a. Dedicating one Hackday to error handling. b. Giving few more people the right to fix internal issues. Have elaborate plans for meta-X projects a. Automate mfqp: Upload paper after selecting the subject from a dropdown list in mfqp itself. b. Increase contents of the wiki: This may be achieved using give-aways. I believe\ncontributing to the wiki is the easiest way one can contribute to metaKGP. And, the time-\nframe set for contribution should be small, and this should be repeated every month. c. Release Naarad v2: Have a strict deadline for Naarad v2. d. Make gyft more usable: This can be achieved by integrating the features of gyft with\nother projects like Naarad, metaBot or a cross-platform application. This may also be\nachieved by putting up gyft on the web from where the other projects may make use of it. Get a professor to guide metaKGP Currently, metaKGP is a student-only body. Having a professor in the group can be\nimportant as (s)he can help us in official matters like booking rooms etc, and (s)he can\nalso help us reach out to other faculty members. Moreover, we shall be forced to get our\nwork done in time if we promise the professor a deadline. This will help bring\nabout a motivation for our work. This is in context with the Github page of metaKGP. I guess it requires more development\nso that one can learn more about metaKGP at a glance. Hall:\nLal Bahadur Shastri Hall of Residence Personal email:[email protected] Institute email:[email protected] a. is certainly useful and doable b. can be hard to pull off, think about why\nwould a society assist us in publicity (not to say they won't), answering why\ncan help you formulate strategies for collaboration. In c. define \"more\nregularly\", weekly/biweekly/monthy MetaKGP services should never go down \"never\" is a very strong word, even very popular commercial services like Amazon\nWeb Services and Github goes down. The steps proposed to reduce down time are\nvery vague and I believe largely unhelpful by large. To make a better case\nabout your proposed solution think about the cases where some of metakgp\nservices have gone down and illustrate how applying your solutions would have\nhelped. Also talk about why do you think increase the availability of metakgp services\nis important. (more comments coming in some time) --Hargup(talk) 20:15, 19 March 2017 (IST)"

        "content": "Metakgp:Old Governance Model/Election October 2017/SOP Kaustubh Hiware I amKaustubh Hiware, a fourth year dual degree Computer Science and Engineering student. I present my case as a potential maintainer for the next year, 2017-2018. I was introduced to metakgp two years ago by Harsh Gupta, where from I gained a better understanding of building community-centric tools. Since then, we’re still more of a code-intensive group of people. I initially wanted to change this image. But then this quote made me think otherwise:”Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you” . Do one thing - do it right. I want to promote that. Let’s become the pillar of support, where ideas and resources are shared by the dozen, with more (and perhaps more focused) channels on the metaKGP slack channel like #tech-help. Examples could be #android, #learnML, #learnAnything #binge #mentors (just some ideas) I've been an active member on slack. I've always been here. I'll always be here. I have a basic idea of every project undertaken by metaKGP yet, which I hope to extend under my tenure as a maintainer. [Wiki] With a ton of changes,hereare all the wiki edits I’ve made. [Code] So far I've made the following contributions: [WIP] A geotagged map for corresponding articles. An idea of expansion suggested by Nishant would be computing some metrics like score based on proximity to market, to institutional buildings, etc. View ithere. This would be similar in concept to TSA'spujomap. (MAG) Hackathons are definitely a better way to reach out. This is one way to increase awareness of metaKGP among freshers. They can be subtly integrated with talks (or rather tech talks). These tech talks can be about some interesting projects that people in the campus have taken up, what their motivation was for the same, what hurdles they might have faced and how they overcame them. (This point also suggested by Rishabh Madan and Siddharth Kannan in Naresh’sSoP).  What would be the motivation of freshers though to attend such hackathons? What metaKGP has to offer is experience that we share in terms of tools, frameworks and utilities. The success of these hackathons would largely depend on the participation from the people within metaKGP. Another possible incentive could be shirts / stickers / memorabilia. Funding for this would be a roadblock here. We could attempt to reach out toMLHor a similar organisation for funding, however past experience suggests this would be a challenge. Another way out for funding is via alumni, which needs setting up a booth during the annual Alumni meet in January. (MAG) Getting more people talking on slack. I think limiting the scope to kgp isn’t right. I’ve known of other societies in other IITs (I am unaware of the scene elsewhere) also have an active slack channel. An example is IIT Roorkee’s SDSLabs. IF we could get some people from there here, I think the scope of discussion would already be widened. We get an opportunity to learn from them, as they might as well. As per themeetup of 27th July, a discussion was to incorporate course reviews more effectively in the wiki. This is crucial to any student who has to choose a depth or elective. An approach could be anonymous feedback on wiki, but this could run into some trouble since this shouldn't be served right away on the wiki. A better approach as per the meeting would be circulating a google form, filter out useful feedback, and adding only those trusted / useful feedback into the course page. Once a base set of courses is worked upon, getting feedback on other courses would be easier. As per SoP discussion, it would be wiser to have a separate website accessible to only KGPians, rather than the whole internet. A separate website could be made, integrated with the dashboard (which means the dashboard has to be active). Now, the access to the website might either be restricted to inside KGP, or adding an ERP-like authentication, which allows only KGP students to access these course review pages. A project with similar objective isCliqery, which is a Q-A site. Similar to the newsletter idealogy presented bySrihari, I think creation of a newsletter and manually preparing a newsletter would take around four hours weekly, or seven hours fortnightly. (The newsletter would be a culmination of the discussions and decisions made, so that a newcomer does not feel out of place / left out). However, the number of new members coming in within that duration is hardly two - three, which would make the task of manual summarization cumbersome and less rewarding. I would suggest summarising weekly discussions in a blog format, which could be published on medium or a stand-alone jekyll blog on metaKGP’s website. Publishing this weekly blog would largely be the maintainer's responsibility. The weekly blog will be shared through the facebook page. This would increase the engagement of people who aren't aware of metaKGP in any way such that people interested in certain topics can also voice their concerns on slack.\nThis point added after the SoP discussion. You do you. - There are people who want to help out others. There are also people, who would rather hang out with a select few, sans judgement. Realistically, only 10 people per batch are actually involved in any sort of communication on slack. Let’s not try to be a place where anyone is forced to do anything they don’t really want to do and unless it's absolutely essential. Let people contribute the way they seem fit, and make the best out of it. No one is really interested in maintaining a project unless they genuinely believe in it.Unmaintained/ out of date projectsneed to be identified and assign an interested mentor / maintainer. The idea is to have a maintainer for every project, this is not a strict bound, only one to better establish a point of contact for someone who has no idea about what metaKGP is or how to contact us. The mentor for every project would be mentioned on the github repositories, and if needed, on the individual pages. Again, this is not a hierarchical thing. Setting up more points of contacts To ensure a member of the slack channel, there must be an initial motivation / push for them to return to the slack channel for discussions. I suggest setting up something similar to mentor-mentee concept, where someone already active on slack can coax newcomers to return, or presenting newcomers a reason to return the channel is a way of increasing the activity on slack. Don’t know. One of the reasons I understand the original KLUG ('06 - '08) couldn’t stand the test of time was less frequent meets, less talks. I personally want more meetings, informal, or 4 people per meet is perfectly fine IMO. Collaboration with other societies As per previous experience, it has been observed any society without active metaKGP people do not end with successful collaborations. The only society I think we have a chance of having proper collaborations is KOSS, simply because of the large number of intersection in these groups. KOSS seems a good way to reach out to an audience who might be actually interested in having conversations here, though more the merrier. If we are interested in having more discussions about art, we could get spectra people to hang around, without any intentions for collaborations. BARC is a good alternative, but I personally don’t think it would be fruitful . However, we can collab with TSA, to have interesting projects which TSA comes up every once in awhile (although one could argue those interesting projects were only because because of Ashris and Vivek Aithal). As suggested by P.N Vamshi, a lot of societies in KGP do not have a website, partly because they do not have members motivated enough to build a separate website for their society. In an attempt to solve this, Governors and heads of various societies can be contacted and asked to post all their upcoming activities / any content they feel relevant about their society on their wiki page. This partly satisfies their need for a separate dedicated website. Also, the following societies’ facebook page can be included in naarad as a feed generator. I have had no administrative role during my stay in KGP. What I can promise is I’ll be transparent in my conduct, never shy away from presenting my thoughts and change, if presented with a better approach. 1. I was a part of AGV for a short period of time, where I mainly dealt with real world models for simulations. 2. Worked as a backend intern atElanic, Bangalore. Acquired a ton of skills which I’d be glad to apply and/or pass on."

        "content": "Metakgp:Old Governance Model/Election October 2017/SOP Srihari Radhakrishna I’m Srihari Radhakrishna, a fifth-year undergraduate student of the department of Electrical Engineering pursuing a dual degree with a specialization in Instrumentation and Signal Processing. I’m a boarder of Patel Hall of Residence. I am an Executive Editor with The Scholars’ Avenue and a debater with Debating Society, IIT Kharagpur. I’m contesting to be elected one of the Maintainers of MetaKGP. My primary motivation for contention springs from my love for the community and projects. Moreover, various ideas on how the community could grow in terms of size and productivity drive my contention. For the duration of my role, if elected, my engagements are minimal and I can afford to spend sufficient amount of time on MetaKGP. If elected as a maintainer, my primary intent would be to arrange for resources so that the community can grow organically - be it seeing projects to the finish line, organizing more avenues for knowledge transfer and of course, inviting more students to be actively contributing members. My association with MetaKGP to date I’ve been a passive member of the community so far with occasional participation in conversations on the Slack channel and few contributions to the wiki. But I’ve always kept a close tab on the developments in the community and of projects. Regardless of the results of the elections, I plan to proactively participate in conversations and contribute to MetaKGP in terms of content and technical facility, henceforth. If elected as a maintainer, these are the broad goals I’d like to affect: Increased participation of students in MetaKGP activities. Positively impact KGP community through regular projects/events - technical and otherwise. Expand the perception of MetaKGP to more than just “a group of coders.” Evolve the MetaKGP experience to more rewarding - in terms of learning, impact and social experience - for all those who are involved. Increasing the MetaKGP reach and participation Problem: While Slack serves MetaKGP well for its needs, I believe it isn’t conducive for someone new to the community to get started. Content discovery isn’t quite as easy - for someone new to the community, information on current projects, past projects (and information about their success/failure) and proposals for newer ones aren’t readily available. There has to be a correlation between this observation and that most active members are people who took to the community in the early days. This is a stark contrast to the objective of the wiki, which is to ease access to information. Solution: I propose a newsletter summarising the developments on projects and decisions made in conversations to be sent out every week. This will be sent out via a new Google Group and MetaKGP Facebook Page. It is to be noted that this doesn’t interfere with the functioning of the existing group on Slack in any manner and would largely be the responsibility of a maintainer. I would also be building a rather comprehensive getting started page and maybe plug it to Eva. The following will roughly be the contents of the newsletter: Current MetaKGP projects and how you can help Proposals that were discussed in group conversations Updates about any interesting additions to the wiki Meetups, hackathons and any other events from (or relevant to) MetaKGP I intend to leverage the Facebook page to a larger extent as a tool for reaching out. In line with the two set of talks that were conducted previously, more talks can be conducted. Also, considering the amount of technical expertise in MetaKGP and otherwise in KGP, there is an opportunity to conduct workshops for transfer of knowledge about anything ranging from tools (like Keerthana’s workshop on Git and Vikrant’s preface to Docker) to research realms (say cryptography or deep learning). Proposal: I intend to leverage my personal contacts and MetaKGP community to find people enthusiastic about conducting workshops on their areas of expertise. We can use the discussion on MetaKGP to figure what people are most enthused about learning. If properly publicised, I believe this can be a great way to engage more people with MetaKGP and for us to be even more relevant to KGP. Hackdays are fun and as a maintainer, I want to enable more frequent hackathons. Hackdays introduce new projects, help contributors find projects and of course provides an impetus to build prototypes. Hackdays have been successfully conducted in the past but there is plenty space for improvement. Proposal: I propose to brand the hackdays differently so that it provides an opportunity for anyone in the KGP community to come forward a present whatever they are working on. Hackdays can sound intimidating but I think with sufficient rebranding (through Facebook, Google Group and word of mouth), students would be incentivized to present their work. One way of doing this is to recharacterize the hackday presentations as an opportunity to present any work irrespective of when it was done or what it is about. Recognition for contributions and SWAG The community recognizes major contributors through the FB page and lists maintained on the wiki. I intend to institute practices to provide even more incentives for contributions apart from the inherent rewards. We can reward wiki contributions, code contributions, and hackday participations. Proposal: SWAG. Now, obviously funding is the bottleneck. I intend to provide for this by possibly attracting sponsorship. Also, employed members may provide for SWAG and the fact that the infrastructure is largely financially supported by founders/members sets a precedent. Also, I intend to resume the practice of recognizing weekly top contributors. As the maintainer, I would like to propose newer ways to think about working on projects so that they are even more impactful. For an average KGPian, MetaKGP is mfqp and/or mftp. It has to be observed that these projects were built and released over a shorter period of time and based on use, were worked upon to improve them. Contrast this with the development of Naarad which was elaborate but somehow failed to attain critical mass. Proposal: This is less of a proposal and more of a way to think about projects. I think the team needs to show bias for action and be willing to experiment with ideas extensively until they hit the right spots. As a characteristic of the group of people who are actively working on projects, enthusiasm about building stuff precedes anything else. As a maintainer, I’d encourage project maintainers to actively push out their project in pre-beta stages to the KGP and use metrics and feedback to further develop the project. Collaboration with other societies I believe it’s conducive for MetaKGP's growth if we actively collaborate symbiotically with other societies on campus. Proposal: I plan to actively communicate with heads of other societies to figure ways in which they can contribute to the growth of MetaKGP and vice versa. For example, I think there’s a lot of benefits to reaped of a collaboration between The Scholars’ Avenue and MetaKGP in that both these groups deal with information and getting them to KGPians. I would encourage and breed inventive ideas on ways in which such collaborations can be most effective. Proposed Personal Contributions As mentioned, I’d amp up my involvement with the community and would extensively contribute to the wiki and to projects. Also, there are a bunch of ideas that I’d love to present to the team, get feedback on and start working on."

        "content": "Metakgp:Organization and coordination Currently there is no formal organization of the people running metakgp. There is an informal group which informally divides the work among itself. There are proposals to add more structure to the organization of MetaKGP for long term growth and sustainability. Arguments against formal organization Arguments in favor of Formal Organization Jo Freeman in her essayTyranny of the Structurelessdescribed that there is no \"structureless organization\" and only implicitly structured and formally organizations. The implicit power structures formed by implicit organization are not only inefficient, the power structures are also hard to recognize and rectify. In the case of KGP it has been seen that without formal roles and organization of volunteers, the other responsibilities of people take over and it becomes hard to get the work done. Jo Freeman also defines following principles of democratic structuring 1.Delegationof specific authority to specific individuals for specific tasks by democratic procedures. Letting people assume jobs or tasks only by default means they are not dependably done. If people are selected to do a task, preferably after expressing an interest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment which cannot so easily be ignored. 2. Requiring all those to whom authority has been delegated to beresponsibleto those who selected them. This is how the group has control over people in positions of authority. Individuals may exercise power, but it is the group that has ultimate say over how the power is exercised. 3.Distribution of authorityamong as many people as is reasonably possible. This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in positions of authority to consult with many others in the process of exercising it. It also gives many people the opportunity to have responsibility for specific tasks and thereby to learn different skills. 4.Rotation of tasksamong individuals. Responsibilities which are held too long by one person, formally or informally, come to be seen as that person's \"property\" and are not easily relinquished or controlled by the group. Conversely, if tasks are rotated too frequently the individual does not have time to learn her job well and acquire the sense of satisfaction of doing a good job. 5.Allocation of tasks along rational criteria.Selecting someone for a position because they are liked by the group or giving them hard work because they are disliked serves neither the group nor the person in the long run. Ability, interest, and responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection. People should be given an opportunity to learn skills they do not have, but this is best done through some sort of \"apprenticeship\" program rather than the \"sink or swim\" method. Having a responsibility one can't handle well is demoralizing. Conversely, being blacklisted from doing what one can do well does not encourage one to develop oneskills. Women have been punished for being competent throughout most of human history; the movement does not need to repeat this process. 6.Diffusion of informationto everyone as frequently as possible. Information is power. Access to information enhances one's power. When an informal network spreads new ideas and information among themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the process of forming an opinion-without the group participating. The more one knows about how things work and what is happening, the more politicallyeffective one can be. 7.Equal access to resourcesneeded by the group. This is not always perfectly possible, but should be striven for. A member who maintains a monopoly over a needed resource (like a printing press owned by a husband, or a darkroom) can unduly influence the use of that resource. Skills and information are also resources. Members' skills can be equitably available only when members arc willing to teach what they know to others. Holacracy is an organizational model which promises to do with bureaucracy and power centralization without incurring the inefficiencies associated with a lack of formal structure. It is done through organizing people in \"circles\". Each circle is responsible with effective execution of a particular tasks, each circle can be comprised of smaller circles for sub responsibilities. The way it differs from standard Hierarchical models is that people can be part of more than one circle depending on their skills and strengths and people can move in and out of circles depending on the situation. TheBlinkracyhandbook of Holacracy describes a set of rules and guidelines for effective management and communication. The biggest disadvantage of Holacracy is that and none of people involved in Metakgp are experienced in running and working in a organization modeled on Holacracy. Holacracy it is a new and untested model which might lead to confusion and lack of coordination among team members.User:Amravalso described Holacracy as over management."
